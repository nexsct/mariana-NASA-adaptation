729~THE ground AROUND THE airport WAS PATCHY cover WITH SNOW give IT A mottle LOOK.feature ON THE ground WERE NOT VERY clear AND distinguish A MINOR contribute FACTOR.ON SHORT FINAL I start TO THINK THIS look NARROW AND I wonder IF THERE WAS A displace THRESHOLD AND I WAS wonder WHY IS THE centerline YELLOW.I continue FAT DUMB AND HAPPY TO A NICE TOUCHDOWN AND TOUCH AND GO ON THE taxiway WHICH parallelrunway.UPON climbout I notice I HADN T push IN THE carburetorheat EVEN THOUGH I WENT mental THROUGH TOUCH AND GO checklist.ANOTHER SIGN OF be BEHIND THE PLANE AND NOT think.IT WAS ONLY ON DOWNWIND look FOR AT THE runway FOR MY NEXT TOUCH AND GO THAT I realize I HAD DONE MY LAST on ON THE PARALLEL.I THEN DID _ MORE TOUCH AND go ON runway.I DON T THINK THE tower notice BECAUSE NOTHING WAS say.I WAS surprise AT HOW easy IT happen EVEN WITH THE question come TO MIND.SOME factor LACK OF recentexperience OVER THE LAST _ year OR SO BUT THAT south WHY I WAS UP THERE do TOUCH AND go.NOT think AHEAD OF THE PLANE OR ABOUT WHAT I SHOULD BE do OR see.TERRAIN blur BECAUSE OF SNOW.ALSO I fly A LOT IN ALASKA AND MANY OF THE strip I land ON UP THERE WERE UNIMPROVED OR SMALL pave strip.THE paralleltaxiway look LIKE lot OF runway I VE land ON BEFORE IT DIDN T lookout OF PLACE TO ME.I JUST fail TO SEE ANTICIPATE A normal mark pave runway RIGHT NEXT TO IT.
736~IT WAS THE END OF MY dutyday AND THE WORKLOAD ALL DAY WAS VERY BUSY WITH delay.WITH _ differentaircraft type AND _ line OF FLTS.THE minimumequipmentlist FOR defer THE groundspoiler AND antiskid IS VERY VAGUE.I MADE A MISTAKE AND miss THE connect.
750~I receive A RADIO CALL FROM A maintenancetechnician VXVX IN regard TO aircraft XYZ leadingedge horizontalstabilizer dent.I WENT TO aircraft AT GATE XX lefthand leadingedge HAD _ dent.INBOARD DENT HAD A mark OUTBOARD DENT HAD A mark mean THEY WERE previous defer.THE MIDDLE DENT WAS THE MAIN DENT IN QUESTION.I HAD THE TECHNICIAN PULL UP THE _ SRM structure REPAIR MANUAL TO SEE WHAT THE limit WERE.TECHNICIAN CAME BACK TO aircraft WITH SRM _.IT WAS determine THAT DENT WAS WITHIN limit.LOG PAGE WAS sign OFF AS PER SRM DENT IS WITHIN limit.mark apply TO DENT AREA.aircraft proceed TO WWW.IN THE NEXT HOUR I BECAME CURIOUS ABOUT anytime limit THAT MAY BE associate WITH THIS DENT.IT WAS THEN THAT I pull UP THE SRM TO FURTHER check ani limit AND FOUND THAT _ page HAD BEEN LEFT OUT.on PAGE HAD THE ZONE dimension WHICH GAVE YOU A CERTAIN REPAIR WITH flight hour.IN THIS CASE WE FELL INTO ZONE _.ZONE _ STIPULATES THAT FOR _ INCH WIDE BY _ DEEP DENT _ YOU FILL DENT PER SRM south._ SEAL damage WITH ALUMINUM SPEED TAPE._ MAKE A detail visualinspection OF THE DAMAGE AT EACH _ flight hour interval IF THERE ARE crack OR THE DAMAGE HAS BECOME large REPAIR THE DAMAGE._ INSTALL A PERMANENT REPAIR AFTER NO MORE THAN _ flight hour OR _ month THAT WHICH occur FIRST.I THEN notify MY manage onduty OF this situate.I ALSO notify ZZZ aircraft maintain of the situate.
752~ON february _ AT approximate _ PM I WAS cruise AT _ feetmeansealevel WHEN enginefailure occur.I notice A LAKE BELOW ME SO I continue toward THE LAKE make A CIRCLE FOR A land.I BELIEVE THE problem WAS carburetorice.I pull THE carburetorheat HANDLE BUT power WAS NOT restore AND A land WAS need.I BELIEVE THAT I DID NOT GIVE THE aircraft carburetorheat ENOUGH TIME TO HEAT BECAUSE IT WAS A shorttime FROM WHEN I pull THE carburetorheat TO THE TIME I land.WHEN THE aircraft south MAIN _ tire touch DOWN THEY STUCK INTO THE SNOW AND SLUSH cause THE aircraft TO STOP sudden AND THE NOSE TIRE HIT THE SNOW AND COLLAPSE.I WAS NOT HURT AND MY right KNEE HAD A LIGHT BRUISE FROM hit INTO THE carburetorheat AND FLAP HANDLE.THE aircraft HAD DAMAGE TO THE land GEAR NOSE ONLY propel AND cowl.I walk OVER TO A HOUSE ON THE LAKE AND call FOR HELP.
757~I WAS dispatch TO ZZZ FROM XXX TO REPAIR AN _ stabilize TRIM problem.PRIOR TO DISPATCH I WAS brief THAT A PREVIOUS maintenancecrew HAD replace THE MANUAL control LINK ROD AND THE RIG WAS SUSPECT.AFTER arrive AT ZZZ THE maintenancecoordinator inform ME THAT THE stabilize TRIM actuate PRIMARY MOTOR WAS ALSO setup TO BE replace.I replace THE MOTOR AND sign THE ITEM OFF IN THE LOGBOOK.I DID NOT ASK THE coordinate ABOUT THE replace be AN RII ITEM.SINCE THE SUBJECT DID NOT COME UP I assume IT WAS NOT.THE ITEM WAS sign OFF ON february _.I return TO WORK ON february _ AND AFTER review event OF THE previousday ask THE inspect FOREMAN IF THE replace WAS RII.HE respond YES AND I immediate contact MY supervise AND maintain coordinate.maintenancecoordinator XA XYZ immediate issue AN inspect ON THE COMPONENT TO BE complete BEFORE THE nextflight.
758~ON february _ I WAS assign A WORK RELEASE ITEM FOR A BOEING _ aircraft.THE WORK ITEM HAD A maintenancetechnician serve jobcard request THAT A digitalflight DATA ACQUISITION UNIT DFDAU BE replace FOR troubleshoot purpose.THE jobcard THEN request THE aircraftcommunicationsaddressingandreportingsystem BE defer UNTIL engine CONDITION monitor COULD BE verify FROM engineer.THE jobcard state THAT THE CLASS control NUMBER FOR THE DFDAU WAS WXXXX AT OUR LINE stockroom THE NIGHTLY ROTABLE PART PRINTOUT show A WXXXX WAS receive FOR THIS aircraft.I install THE DFDAU PER maintain MANUAL.LATER I complete THE part TAG AND us THE SAME CLASS control NUMBER FROM THE SERVICEABLE PART NUMBER FROM THE UNSERVICEABLE NUMBER.WHEN I enter THE DFDAU replace IN THE COMPUTER IT quiz ME TO MAKE SURE THE PART AND SERIAL number WERE CORRECT.I select ACCEPT CURRENT value.THEN I contact maintain control AND TOLD THEM THAT THE jobcard FOR THE DFDAU replace WAS accomplish.THEN PER maintain control I defer THE aircraftcommunicationsaddressingandreportingsystem FOR flight evaluate.THE NEXT NIGHT aircraftcommunicationsaddressingandreportingsystem DATA STILL WAS NOT be receive.maintain swap DFDAU FROM A know GOOD system.THAT south WHEN IT WAS discover I install A _ DFDAU ONTO A _ aircraft.THE DFDAU south align pin ARE THE SAME FOR BOTH aircraft SO EITHER DFDAU CAN BE install ON EITHER aircraft.ALSO THE builtintestequipment TEST FOR THE install DFDAU check GOOD.
766~ON ROUTINE instrumentflightrules TRIP cmh airport TO teb airport.teb airport weather HAD BEEN fluctuate ON visible FROM _ TO _ mile SNOW WITH ceil _ feet.DURING vector FOR instrumentlandingsystemrunway _ approach THE control advise THAT THE aircraft BEHIND US IN SEQUENCE WOULD BE THE LAST AND THAT teb airport WOULD CLOSE AFTER THAT arrive.OUR CREW execute A precis STABLE instrumentlandingsystem approach.WE SAW THE runway AT approximate _ feet ABOVE DECISION altitude continue THE approach AND land.ON TOUCHDOWN AND ROLLOUT WE notice SIGNIFICANT SNOW AND SLUSH buildup ON runway PREVIOUS land aircraft HAD report brake ACTION AS FAIR HOWEVER THE aircraft track STRAIGHT ON THE center OF runway _.AS WE continue TO DECELERATE TOWARD THE northeast END OF runway _ I test brake A BIT MORE forceful.FOUND brake ACTION TO BE FAIR TO POOR AND ask firstofficer TO report IT AS SUCH TO tower.tower instruct US TO TURN left AT taxiway B HOLD SHORT OF runway _.WE HAD COME TO ALMOST A COMPLETE STOP SO AS I turn left TOWARD taxiway B IT require great THAN NORMAL BREAKAWAY THRUST TO MOVE THROUGH SLUSH AND SNOW.AS WE turn ONTO taxiway B WE SAW THAT IT WAS SNOW SLUSH cover EXCEPT FOR TIRE track OF _ precedingaircraft.HOLD SHORT line NOR SIGNAGE WERE VISIBLE IN blowingsnow SNOW cover ON ground precedingaircraft south TIRE track turn sharp AHEAD SO I WAS double concern WITH brake ACTION.I test THE brake AGAIN WHILE try TO REMAIN center AND OUR aircraft slide.brake HERE WAS POOR TO NIL.ONCE THE aircraft stop I realize I WAS ALREADY INTO runway _ edgelight bare VISIBLE.IN THE INTEREST OF expedite I continue TO CROSS INSTEAD OF try TO turnaround IN SLIPPERY condition.tower inform US OF THE encroach AND remind US THAT runway _ WAS ACTIVE FOR departure.WE apologize AND advise WE HAD slide ONTO runway WITH POOR brake ACTION.AT THIS TIME precedingaircraft advise THEY HAD DONE THE SAME.
768~AT _ ON february _ DURING THE land PHASE TO pbi airport airport clearance TO LAND WAS give BY pbi airport tower FROM A right DOWNWIND LEG TO runway.AT THE trafficpattern altitude OF _ feetmeansealevel DURING THE FINAL approach LEG ONLY _ runway COULD BE see runway.THE SECOND runway WAS NOT VISIBLE AT THAT altitude.THERE ARE NO mark ON THE ground TO INDICATE THAT runway IS approximate _ feet AWAY AT THE _ o'clock posit ON THE airport.HAD THERE BEEN SOME BOLD paint mark ON THE ground TO INDICATE THE approximate posit OF runway THIS INCIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE occur.AS THERE WERE sever OTHER aircraft land AT pbi airport AT approximate THE sametime IT WAS CRUCIAL TO LAND ON runway AND NOT mistake LAND ON runway WHICH MAY HAVE result IN AN inflight collide between aircraft.AS runway COULD NOT BE identify AT THIS altitude AND THERE WERE VISIBLE _ SEPARATE PARALLEL pave surface WHICH WERE BOTH clear OF ani aircraft MACHINERY OR obstacle I THE pilot choose THE SURFACE TO THE FARTHEST right IN attempt TO AVOID runway.AS IT turn OUT THE pave SURFACE TO THE FARTHEST right WAS taxiway C.THE VISIBLE pave SURFACE TO THE left WAS runway.THUS THE aircraft land ON taxiway C WITHOUT ani DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR ani injury TO person.THIS COULD HAVE BEEN avoid IF THERE WERE SOME BOLD paint mark ON THE ground TO INDICATE THAT runway WAS approximate _ mile FURTHER TO THE _ o'clock posit ON THE AIRFIELD.
770~I WAS AT cps airport hold SHORT IN LINE number _ AT runway _ FOR depart.AFTER THE aircraftnumber _ IN LINE WAS clear FOR depart tower TOLD THE aircraft IN FRONT OF ME THAT HE WAS clear TO crossrunway _ AND IN THE SAME SENTENCE TOLD ME THAT I WAS TO TAXI INTO posit AND HOLD ON runway _.THE aircraft IN FRONT OF ME cross runway _ AND I taxi INTO posit AND begin MY takeoff ROLL.I HAD repeat THE posit AND HOLD instruct.I start TO ABORT MY takeoff WHEN I SAW A TAMPICO approach TO crossrunway _.THE TAMPICO stop AND NEVER enter THE runway.immediate AFTER I begin TO ABORT THE tower TOLD ME TO STOP.I BELIEVE THIS happen BECAUSE OF _ thing _ I WAS IN A HURRY._ HAD A SECOND RADIO ON AND tune TO ANOTHER frequency distract._ I WAS wonder WHY THE aircraft IN FRONT OF ME HAD wait SO LONG TO crossrunway _ HE COULD HAVE GONE ANOTHER WAY distract._ I WASN T SURE IF ANOTHER PLANE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS number _ IN SEQUENCE FOR runway _ BECAUSE OF OUR posit ON THE RAMP.
773~I WAS ask TO TAXI AN _ FROM THE maintain HANGER TO THE MAIN TERMINAL AT ZZZ.AS PART OF A COMPANY TAXI trainingprogram I WAS occupy THE leftseat AND A LINE captain WAS occupy THE rightseat.MY TASK WAS TO TAXI THE airtransportradio WHILE THE captain WAS TO PERFORM RADIO communicate WITH THE ZZZ groundcontrol.WE HAD BEEN instruct TO taxion taxiway B AND TO HOLD SHORT OF runway enroute TO runway.WE CAME TO THE intersect OF taxiway B AND runway _.THE captain SAW THE HOLD SHORT LINE FOR runway _ AND A departingaircraft ON runway.HE ask ME TO STOP WHICH I DID.I ALSO advise HIM WE WERE AT THE runway _ HOLD SHORT AND NOT runway.HE say TO REMAIN THERE SINCE WE WERE ALREADY stop.ZZZ groundcontrol THEN clear US TO crossrunway _ ON taxiway B AND HOLD SHORT OF runway _.WHILE approach runway HOLD SHORT LINE I ask THE captain IF WE WERE TO HOLD SHORT.HE state WE WERE TO crossrunway runway AND HOLD SHORT OF runway.I ask HIM AGAIN IF HE WAS SURE hi respond WAS posit.I sense NO DOUBT IN hi ANSWER.WE visual check runway FOR traffic NO traffic WAS see IN A takeoffposition AND NO aircraft WERE see ON A SHORT FINAL approach SO WE cross runway.AFTER do SO groundcontrol inform US WE HAD BEEN instruct TO HOLD SHORT OF runway.EVEN THOUGH I HAD ask THE captain WHICH runway _ WE WERE SUPPOSE TO HOLD SHORT OF hi ANSWER prove TO BE WRONG.IF A runway HOLD SHORT VISUAL traffic SIGNAL system WAS develop crew WOULD HAVE VISUAL AND A AUDIO clearance WHEN cross runway.IF THE AUDIO communicate WAS MISINTERPED THE VISUAL SIGNAL AT THE HOLD SHORT LINE COULD HELP PREVENT INADVERTENT cross.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ I WAS check OUT A maintain TAXI pilot FOR recertify OF OUR maintain TAXI PROGRAM.WE HAD brief THE import OF comply WITH ground clearance TO INCLUDE IF ani DOUBT exist STOP AND VERIFY.I HAD THE airportdiagram OUT AND light.FROM THE taxiway B PAD WE WERE clear TO HOLD SHORT OF runway AT taxiway B.I HAD TAXI pilot STOP AT runway _ AS AN aircraft WAS roll FOR takeoff FROM _ o'clock posit TO _ o'clock posit OUR right.THE NEXT clearance WAS crossrunway _ HOLD SHORT OF runway.think OF THE previousclearance AND NOW expect A CROSS OF runway WHILE I READ THIS BACK correct I apparent THOUGHT THE clearance WAS TO crossrunway runway AND HOLD SHORT OF runway.humanfactor THIS airport particular THE NEW CORNER IS COMPLEX AND confuse.THIS WAS THE firsttime I HAD taxi THIS rout.IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SORT OUT THE runway AND taxiway AT NIGHT.WITH _ DISCRETE ground AND _ DISCRETE tower frequency NO on pilot ON ground HAS THE bigpicture.I HAD IN try TO BE care anticipate A clearance WHEN I stop AT runway _.I SHOULD HAVE ask FOR A progress..
784~WE WERE dispatch ON A _ FREIGHTER FROM nrt airport JAPAN TO TPE TAIWAN.THERE WAS _ ITEM IN THE minimumequipmentlist concern THE automaticthrottle system.basic THE minimumequipmentlist say THE system WAS inoperative BUT ani PART OF IT THAT work COULD BE us.ON THE flight FROM _ THE captain south SIDE OF THE automaticthrottle system seem TO WORK normal.ON THE RETURN flight sameday differ flightnumber WE FOUND THAT THE speed selectorknob DIDN T proper SET THE captain south OR THE firstofficer south speed BUG.WE feel THIS WAS IN add TO THE PREVIOUS minimumequipmentlistitem AND write IT UP ON arrive IN nrt airport.WE LATER learn THAT THE flight MAY HAVE BEEN improper dispatch.
787~WE LOST altitude WHEN autopilot WOULD NOT HOLD altitude.autopilot TRIM WAS minimumequipmentlist ED inoperative.IT WAS MY firsttime fly WITH THIS minimumequipmentlist.I select _ degree BANK selectorswitch.THE autopilot command A _ degree BANK AND THEN LET THE NOSE DROP.autopilot DID HAVE altitude CAPTURE annunciate.airtrafficcontrol GAVE US A LARGE INTERCEPT ANGLE TO THE approach AND THE aircraft roll TO THE _ degree BANK immediate.WITH autopilot TRIM inoperative IT COULD NOT MAINTAIN altitude.WE HAD BEEN manual trim aircraft FOR climb descent everytime WE WOULD DISCONNECT autopilot.initial WE LOST _ feet THEN _ feet TO RECOVER.IT CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE.I WAS BUSY review approach PLATE confine ETC._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state HE ONLY HAD _ year EXPERIENCE ON THIS AIRPLANE WHEN THIS INCIDENT occur.THE report say THE autopilot TRIM COUPLER WAS defer AS inoperative AND MANUAL TRIM WAS us THE entireflight WHEN need AND THE autopilot WAS reengage AFTER trim.THE report state WHEN approachcontrol request HOLD _ feet AND A right TURN TO _ degree A TURN WITH _ degreebankangle WAS start WITH THE autopilot.THE report say WHILE IN THE TURN HE was distract look FOR traffic WHEN THE NOSE drop AND _ feet WAS LOST AND ANOTHER _ feet TO REGAIN control.THE report say THE autopilot MADE NO noseup INPUT WHILE IN THE TURN.
795~aircraftnumber _ _ IN trafficpattern FOR runway _ left traffic WAS clear TO LAND ON runway _.ON DOWNWIND complete trafficpattern AND WAS complete land IN FLARE AND ground ROLLOUT THROUGH intersect OF runway _ AND runway _ WHILE simultaneous A CITATION HAD BEEN clear FOR takeoff ON runway _.aircraftnumber _ WAS roll OUT THROUGH intersect AND CITATION HAD BEEN clear FOR takeoff AND WAS roll ON runway _ approximate _ yard separate.
797~I WAS inform TODAY february _ AT _ hour THAT THE oilquantity problem I work ON AND defer ON february _ WAS NO FIX nofly AND I WANT TO report THIS EVENT.I WAS UNAWARE OF THE CONDITION AND WAS NOT inform BY THE crewchief OR TECHNICIAN service WHO WE WERE IN CONTACT WITH ABOUT THE problem.
804~WE CAME OUT OF _ line OF weather NEAR THE bunt intersect WHILE transit FROM ZNY TO phl airport approachcontrol.DUE TO A highcockpitworkload WE DID NOT CATCH THAT phl airport WAS land runway RATHER THAN THE USUAL runway ON THE aircraftcommunicationsaddressingandreportingsystem automaticterminalinformationservice.WE brief AND setup FOR THE instrumentlandingsystem TO runway.WE WERE give numerousvectors WHICH conclude WITH A TURN TO _ degree TO INTERCEPT THE locate.short THEREAFTER WE WERE clear FOR THE approach.I DO NOT RECALL THAT THE control specify instrumentlandingsystemrunway.HE THEN TOLD US TO CONTACT THE tower AT THE mark.WE call THE tower AT SPEEZ intersect.THE tower say number _ CONTINUE.tower THEN clear US TO LAND WHEN WE WERE AT _ feet.WE land ON runway taxi clear AND WENT TO THE GATE.WE GOT A MESSAGE TO CALL THE tower BY PHONE.THERE WAS NO trafficconflict.OUR USUAL land runway IN phl airport IS runway.VERY simple PUT NEITHER WE NOR THE control CAUGHT THAT WE WERE line UP FOR AND land ON THE wrongrunway.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ WE setup COCKPIT AND brief THE runway approach AND follow IT DOWN ON locate OR autopilot TO land.WE WERE clear BY approach TO FLY _ degree TO INTERCEPT THE locate.short AFTER WE GOT clear FOR THE instrumentlandingsystem TO THE BEST I CAN REMEMBER HE DID NOT SAY WHICH runway.WE WERE TOLD TO contacttower OVER mark AND AGAIN HE DID NOT GIVE US THE NAME BECAUSE I look AT approach PLATE TO MAKE SURE IT WAS SPEEZ intersect.WHEN WE check IN ALL tower say WAS number _ AND TO CONTINUE approach.AT _ feet WE WERE clear TO LAND AND I DO NOT REMEMBER IF HE say runway OR JUST clear TO LAND.WE land ON runway WITH NO trafficconflict AND proceed TO GATE.THE bottomline IS WE DID NOT CATCH THE CHANGE IN runway AND approach AND tower DID NOT EITHER BECAUSE WE WERE capture ON THE right SIDE south locate ON autopilot TO _ feetabovegroundlevel.
807~approachcontrol clear US FOR THE VISUAL ON runway.WHEN hand OFF TO THE localcontroller HE clear US FOR runway.WITH THE CHATTER OF A train environ WITH A copilot IN train AND THE gust weather WE THOUGHT HE HAD clear US FOR runway WHICH IS WHAT WE land ON.
812~EVENT occur DURING takeoff FROM _ airport HAITI.AFTER _ HAITIAN own operate turbopropaircraft land ON runway _ AT _ airport THE towercontroller call ME ON THE PHONE AT _ TO ADVISE ME THAT HE WAS close THE tower AND HE ask ME WHAT MY intent WERE.I TOLD HIM WE STILL HAD ADEQUATE visible AND visualreference SUNSET IS AT _ TO ATTEMPT A takeoff.HE acknowledge AND GAVE ME THE local weather _ mile visible wind northeast AT _ knot ALTIMETER _ inch.THE firstofficer WAS THE pilotflying FOR THIS LEG OF THE flight TO fll airport.WE ramp OUT AT _ AND backtaxi ON runway _ FOR takeoff.AS WE accelerate DOWN THE runway AT _ WE notice A COW walk IN THE GRASS OFF TO THE right SIDE OF THE runway WHICH IS A NORMAL occur SINCE THAT airport IS NOT fence.WHEN WE rotate OFF THE ground THE COW attempt TO CROSS THE runway ABOUT _ feet IN FRONT OF THE aircraft.WE clear IT VERTLY BY _ feet.THE REST OF THE flight WAS UNEVENTFUL.
816~WHILE taxi FOR depart AT dca airport WE WERE clear ACROSS runway _ AT taxiway K FOR takeoff ON runway _.BOTH OURSELVES AND A _ WERE clear ACROSS AT THE sametime.AS WE start ACROSS WE SAW A DASH _ BEGIN it takeoff ROLL ON runway _.OTHER aircraft AND OURSELVES stop AND THE DASH _ abort THE takeoff.WE WERE reclear ACROSS AND receive confirm OF OUR originalclearance.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ _ WAS ALSO clear TO CROSS AT taxiway J.WE WERE ON ground AND I ASSUME HE WAS ON tower.
818~WHEN I arrive AT aircraft I note THAT THERE WERE _ minimumequipmentlist south ON THE LOGBOOK left FORWARD boostpump AND left FUEL GAUGE.I READ THE minimumequipmentlist FOR THE boostpump AND THEN THE minimumequipmentlist.THE FIRST fail TO MENTION THAT YOU CAN T HAVE BOTH AND IN MY hast I fail TO NOTE THAT THE FUEL GAUGE minimumequipmentlist clear state THAT BOTH boostpump MUST BE operate.THERE real IS NO EXCUSE FOR miss THIS BUT factor involve WERE rush TO MEET THE on time depart AND think THAT BOTH maintain AND DISPATCH HAVE give THEIR approve FOR THE RELEASE.I WILL TAKE THE TIME TO READ NOT SCAN ALL minimumequipmentlist south.WITHOUT A DOUBT I SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT AND I WILL IN THE FUTURE.WHEN WE arrive AT OUR destinate maintain meet THE aircraft inform ME THAT IT HAD BEEN release WITH AN ILLEGAL minimumequipmentlist apologize AND ground THE PLANE.DISPATCH ALSO call TO apology FOR NOT catch THE problem.DON T RUSH.THE flight WAS conduct WITH NO incident.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ fuelquantity indicate minimumequipmentlist IS quit COMMON AND THIS MAY HAVE add TO complacent.
821~DURING taxiout AT stl airport WE WERE give instruct TO TAXI TO runway bywayof taxiway D AND taxiway C TO crossrunway runway AND HOLD SHORT OF runway.AS THE NOSE OF THE aircraft cross THE HOLD SHORT LINE OF runway ABOUT _ feet WE WERE give NEW instruct TO STOP immediate.THERE WAS A _ IN posit ON runway BUT HAD NOT BEEN give takeoff instruct BECAUSE THERE WERE aircraft cross runway DOWN AT taxiway right AND taxiway south THAT HAD land ON runway.THERE WERE sever aircraft WITH SIMILAR clearance THAT HAD change sever time.THIS lead TO SOME confuse ON OUR PART.
822~AFTER land ON runway IN ewr airport WE WERE hold SHORT between runway AND runway.tower clear A _ flight BXA TO crossrunway runway AND contactground.WE WERE operate flight GXA AND THOUGHT WE WERE give clearance TO CROSS THE runway.WE proceed TO crossrunway runway AND AT THE sametime ANOTHER aircraft WAS clear TO LAND AND WAS TOLD TO goaraound BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE proximity.AFTER discuss THE INCIDENT WITH ewr airport tower supervise NO FURTHER ACTION WILL BE take.I BELIEVE THE close OF THE _ callsign contribute TO THE MISCOM.
825~I WAS ON THE _ DAY OF _ daytrip.I HAD TO report THAT DAY AT _.I WAS ON THE _ AND lastleg OF THE TRIP IN instrumentmeteorologicalconditions WITH clearice buildingup ON MY AIRPLANE WITH THE autopilot inoperative.THE center control turn US IN HIGH AND TIGHT FOR THE approach AND THE runway WAS SNOW AND ICE cover WITH WHITEOUT condition.ZBW ON _ clear flight FOR THE instrumentlandingsystemrunway _ approach TO PRESQUE ISLE airport.WE WERE AT _ feetmeansealevel AT _ mile FROM THE finalapproachfix.WE WERE vector HIGH ON THE glideslope SO WE increase OUR RATE OF descend TO INTERCEPT THE glideslope.THE autopilot WAS minimumequipmentlist ED inoperative SO I HAD TO handfly THE approach us ONLY THE flightdirector.AT _ feet TO _ feet WE WERE encounter freezingrain AND pick UP clearice ON THE aircraft.AFTER THE approach control ZBW clear US FOR THE approach HE NEVER switch US TO PRESQUE ISLE commontrafficadvisoryfrequency ON _.WE THE CREW ALSO forget TO GO TO THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequency.AFTER land ON runway _ THE firstofficer AND I SAW A PLOW TRUCK approximate _ mile DOWN THE runway ON THE lefthand SIDE plow SNOW drive AWAY FROM US.I manage TO STOP THE aircraft approximate _ feet BEHIND THE PLOW TRUCK AND exit THE runway AT taxiway C AND pull UP THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequency AND announce ON THE RADIO THAT flight WAS clear runway _ AT PRESQUE ISLE.BY THE TIME WE SAW THE TRUCK WE HAD ALREADY land ON THE runway AND feel THAT do A goaraound ON A SNOW AND ICE cover runway AND go backup INTO freezingrain WOULD BE A LOT MORE danger THAN JUST stop BEHIND THE PLOW TRUCK WHICH WAS drive AWAY FROM US ANYWAY.
827~WE WERE TO operate OUT OF stl airport TO cvg airport.WE WERE instruct TO TAXI TO runway bywayof taxiway A HOLD SHORT OF runway AT taxiway H TO runway FROM THE north SIDE.AS WE MADE THE left TURN ONTO taxiway H TO HOLD SHORT WE WERE instruct TO crossrunway runway.AS WE cross NEITHER THE captain OR MYSELF COULD MAKE OUT taxiway H ON THE OTHER SIDE OF runway.ALL I SAW WAS THE EDGE OF THE runway.THERE WAS traffic ON A TWO mile FINAL TO runway.THE captain immediate TOOK THE taxiway HE COULD MAKE OUT WHICH WAS taxiway north.THERE WAS NO CONFLICT.WE clear THE runway AND THE aircraft ON FINAL land uneventful.HOWEVER THE taxiway H WAS poor light AND DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT clear.WE COULD HAVE decline THE clearance TO CROSS UNTIL BOTH OF US COULD SEE THE taxiway BEFORE WE cross.
828~IN ewr airport flight XYZ WE complete ALL checklist IN comply WITH THE FOM AND start engine.I proper coordinate WITH ewr airport RAMP control AND THE groundcrew FOR THE PUSH FROM GATE.WE ALL HAD OUR head OUT OF THE COCKPIT.DURING THE PUSHBACK WE hear SOMETHING AND I TOLD THE TUG drive TO STOP.HE say WE ARE go TO TAKE YOU BACK INTO GATE AND I say STOP DUE TO THE align OF THE aircraft.A mechanic THEN advise ME THAT THEY HAD A problem AND need TO REALIGN THE aircraft.SINCE THEY WERE THE ONLY individual THAT COULD SEE WHY WE need TO BE realign AND COULD SEE THE EXTERIOR OF THE aircraft rely ON THEIR profession judge I agree TO THE PUSH.I subsequent learn THE aircraft WAS damage.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ WE THEN hear A NOISE FROM left SIDE OF aircraft.THE captain TOLD groundcrew TO STOP.THEY push THE aircraft BACK OUT AND pull IT IN.AFTER park AND get OFF THE aircraft WE subsequent FOUND OUT THE left SIDE OF THE NOSE HAD STRUCK THE load DOCK PORTION OF THE build.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ PRIOR TO PUSH ALL engine HAD BEEN start DUE fault auxiliarypowerunit ALL checklist complete AND ALL APPROPRIATE radiocall WERE COMPLETE.LESS THAN _ second IN TO PUSH CREW hear A scrape NOISE AND advise TOW CREW TO STOP.THE aircraft HAD impact THE load RAMP DURING PUSHBACK result IN SIGNIFICANT skindamage ON NOSE OF aircraft.visible ON _ AND RAMP locate preclude flightcrew aware OF impend CONTACT.aircraft WAS UNDER physic AND VISUAL control OF groundcrew DURING INCIDENT.
833~SMALL generalaviation aircraft land ON runway AS WE HELD SHORT OF runway fulllength.AFTER be clear INTO posit WE WERE clear FOR takeoff.WE begin A normaltakeoff ROLL ON runway fulllength.AT approximate _ knot WITH A _ knot rotationspeed BOTH pilot SAW THAT THE LIGHT civilaircraft WAS STILL ON THE EXTREME left SIDE OF runway move slow TOWARD taxiway C OR D.A HIGH speed ABORT appear risk SO WE move OUR aircraft TO THE right OF centerline TO ENSURE clearance FROM THE LIGHT CIVIL.THE captain transmit OVER towerfrequency THAT THE LIGHT CIVIL need TO clear THE runway rapid.AS OUR nosegear clear THE runway WE pass JUST TO THE right SIDE OF THE LIGHT CIVIL.OUR aircraft WAS WELL right OF centerline.ON frequency CHANGE TO depart THE tower say SORRY ABOUT THAT.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ I announce THE NEED FOR LIGHT civilaircraft TO clear runway quick.NEAR MISS result.THE ENTIRE takeoff ROLL WAS execute WITH BOTH aircraft occupy THE SAME activerunway.I VOICE MY ONGOING CONCERN ABOUT airtrafficcontrolhandling AT rdu airport.

1639~FORMER manage ya and P AND certificatedflightinstructor OF THE COMPANY hire ME IN THE CAPACITY OF certificatedflightinstructor AROUND _.EVEN THEN IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR Y TO MAINTAIN UPDATE AND SAFEGUARD THE aircraftlogbook.FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF OTHER pilot Y create A SPREADSHEET THAT automate calculate maintain interval AND THE TIME remain ON vary aircraft component depend ON THE tachometer TIME enter IN THE COMPUTER.HE ALWAYS prefer TO HAVE other REFER TO THAT SOURCE RATHER THAN us THE logbook UNLESS absolute NECESSARY.THIS SPREADSHEET TOGETHER WITH OTHER PAPERWORK BECAME PART OF OUR heliport BOOK.AT THE begin OF THIS year IT WAS decide THAT Y WOULD NO long WORK FOR heliport COMPANY AND I inherit A NUMBER OF THE responsible THAT Y us TO HANDLE.SINCE I AM NOT AN aircraft mechanic THE ACTUAL maintain OF THE aircraft WAS shift FROM Y TO Z.THE logbook ALSO WENT INTO Z south CARE AT THAT TIME.accord TO OUR SPREADSHEET THE SPINDLES HAD ONLY A FEW hour LEFT _ hour WHICH prompt ME TO RETRIEVE THE logbook AND double check Y south MATH make SURE THAT IT WAS INDEED ABOUT TIME FOR maintain.IN do SO I FOUND A MISTAKE HE MADE IN calculate THE TIME remain ON THE SPINDLES.THE MISTAKE WAS NOT APPARENT.IT TOOK ME A week OR SO TO FIND OUT HOW THE MISTAKE WAS MADE.MY FIRST GUESS WAS THAT Y HAD MADE A SIMPLE MATH ERROR.TO CALCULATE THE tachometer TIME THAT REPRESENTS THE hour THAT A give COMPONENT WILL COME DUE YOU NEED TO TAKE THE COMPONENT south TIME remain AND ADD THAT TO THE tachometer read AT THE TIME OF install.apparent Y add THE tachometer TIME AT install TO THE NUMBER OF hour fly ON THE COMPONENT INSTEAD.THIS RESULT WAS A NUMBER THAT happen TO BE ABOUT _ hour TOO MANY.subsequent WE fly ON borrow blade SPINDLES FOR ABOUT _ hour reduce THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE overfly THE SPINDLES TO ABOUT _ hour.THIS NUMBER seem TOO HIGH THOUGH.IT DID NOT MAKE SENSE WITH OTHER maintain describe IN THE logbook.I report THIS MISTAKE TO THE ZZZ flightstandardsdistrictoffice AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS MADE.THEN UPON closerinspection OF THE logbook I FOUND THAT THE MISTAKE happen FOR differ reason.IT WAS A CASE OF simple write DOWN A WRONG NUMBER ON OUR SPREADSHEET IN THE heliport BOOK.INSTEAD OF write DOWN AN INTERVAL OF _ hour HE write _.THE NUMBER _ WAS suppose TO REPRESENT THE TIME LEFT ON THE SPINDLES AT THE TIME THAT OUR OWN blade WERE reinstall AFTER THE borrow blade LEFT.BY write DOWN _ WE WERE _ hour TOO LIBERAL.SINCE I FOUND THE MISTAKE _ hour BEFORE TIME WAS suppose TO BE UP WE overfly THE SPINDLES BY _ hour.THE MISTAKE WAS NOT intent ON MY SIDE AND I AM SURE THAT IT WASN T intent ON Y south SIDE EITHER.AT THE ZZZ flightstandardsdistrictofficeinspector TOLD ME NOT TO FILL OUT A nationalaeronauticsandspaceadministrationform SINCE THIS WAS go TO BE AN airworthy ISSUE.RATHER I SHOULD FILL OUT A DISCLOSURE FORM.THIS TOOK A FEW day BUT end UP be POINTLESS SINCE WE WERE NOT operate UNDER A PART _ certify.final THE inspect change hi MIND AND MADE IT A flight operate ISSUE AGAIN leave ME WITH THE OPTION OF fill OUT A nationalaeronauticsandspaceadministrationform A week OR SO AFTER THE occur.I HAVE give A LOT OF THOUGHT ON HOW TO AVOID A MISTAKE OF THIS SORT FROM happen AGAIN.IT IS PUZZLING BECAUSE IT seem THAT THE VAST major OF pilot THAT I TALK TO CONCUR WITH ME IN THAT IT seem CUSTOMARY TO ENSURE airworthy BY look AT THE heliport BOOK AND do A GOOD preflight.IT WOULD BE UNUSUAL FOR A pilot TO SCRUTINIZE THEIR employ south logbook analyze ALL THE COMPONENT time BEFORE THEY start fly FOR THAT operate.AT THE sametime IT IS THE pilotincommand south responsible TO DETERMINE THAT THE aircraft IS AIRWORTHY FOR flight.IN THE END I CAME UP WITH THESE thought _ have AN OPEN LOGBOOK POLICY IS A goodidea SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN double check AND possible FIND AN ERROR OF THIS SORT IN THE FUTURE._ trust ANOTHER PERSON south WORK blind IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT I WILL AVOID FROM NOW ON._ AND final have A.
1643~MY STUDENT AND I WERE give clearance TO TAXI TO THE activerunway.AS WE WERE taxi I WAS explain TO MY STUDENT THE PROPER technique FOR ground operate WHEN I notice A gv ON A converge taxiway.I conclude THAT THE JET WAS NO FACTOR AND continue TO TAXI.AS WE pass THE intersect ground radio TO TELL US THAT THEY want US TO HOLD FOR THE JET.I HAD apparent miss A RADIO CALL WHEN I WAS talk TO MY STUDENT.LATER AN federalaviationadministrationinspector ON THE JET contact ME TO SAY THAT THE JET HAD right of way SINCE IT WAS LESS maneuver.I UNDERSTAND THAT RULE apply IN THE AIR BUT ON THE ground I THOUGHT YOU COMPLY WITH airtrafficcontrolinstruction concern right of way.IF I hear THE RADIO CALL I WOULD HAVE comply BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF airtrafficcontrolinstruction DO LESS maneuver aircraft HAVE right of way.
1646~THE HISTORY show pilotreport FROM september _ AS PLEASE check number _ MAIN land GEAR FOR CORD show.THE signoff WAS OK FOR serve BY A mechanic IN ZZZ.MY firstofficer mention TO ME THAT THE number _ MAIN land GEAR WAS real NEW.I WENT TO LOOK AT MYSELF AND SURE ENOUGH NO sticker ON THE TIRE BUT IT WAS ABOUT A NEW A TIRE AS THEY COME.AS A MATTER OF FACT ALL THE tire WERE HARDLY WORN AT ALL.THIS puzzle ME SO I call maintain.THEY say THERE ARE NO long TIRE CHANGE log IN THE LOGBOOK ON THE CARDBOARD DIVIDERS AND IF A CHANGE IS DONE IT IS MADE AS A REGULAR ENTRY.I QUESTION WHY A CREW WOULD writeup A NEW TIRE.
1650~I WAS clear TO TAXI FROM park AT THE fixedbaseoperator AT _ internationalairport TO runway.I stop AT THE HOLD SHORT LINE AND TOLD THE tower I WAS READY FOR takeoff.tower TOLD ME TO HOLD SHORT WHICH I DID.NEXT I hear TAXI INTO posit AND HOLD.I THOUGHT I HAD hear THE tower us MY tailnumber WHEN issue THAT instruct.I readback THE instruct TAXI INTO posit AND HOLD SMA wait A FEW second AS IS MY HABIT AND hear NO respond FROM THE tower I taxi INTO posit AND HELD ON THE runway.AFTER approximate _ second TO _ minute ON THE runway THE towercontroller CAME ON THE RADIO AND ask ME WHAT I WAS do ON THE runway.I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD taxi INTO posit AND HELD AND THEN ask HIM WHAT HE want ME TO DO.AT THAT POINT HE clear ME FOR takeoff.AFTER discuss THIS MATTER WITH A control LATER BY TELEPHONE I learn THAT THE instruct WAS issue TO ANOTHER PLANE ON THE parallelrunway.coincident AT THE TIME THAT I WAS read BACK MY instruct TO THE tower THE tower begin transmit TO THE OTHER PLANE.apparent MY transmit WAS step ON SO THAT THE towercontroller COULD NOT RESPOND TO MY READBACK TO TELL ME TO CONTINUE TO HOLD SHORT.THE problem arise BECAUSE THE instruct TO TAXI INTO posit AND HOLD CAME RIGHT AFTER ANOTHER SMALL generalaviation PLANE IN FRONT OF ME HAD take OFF.therefor IT WAS COMMON FOR ME TO GET AN instruct TO TAXI AND HOLD AFTER A PLANE HAD take OFF.PERHAPS MY MINDSET lead ME TO CONFUSE THE callsign THAT THE control HAD us.A contribute FACTOR TO THIS INCIDENT WAS THE COINCIDENCE THAT I readback MY instruct AT exact THE sametime THAT ANOTHER PERSON WAS transmit THUS step ON MY transmit SO THAT THE towercontroller COULD NOT HEAR IT AND CORRECT ME IN TIME.IT IS require OF pilot TO readback instrument clearance AND instruct give TO THEM BY control.PERHAPS IT WOULD CUT DOWN runwayincursion IF THE pilot HAD TO HEAR READBACK CORRECT BEFORE execute taxiinstruction.BUT SINCE THAT IS NOT current DONE I TOOK THE control south silent TO MEAN THAT I HAD readback THE instruct correct.MY correctiveaction WILL BE TO LISTEN MORE careful TO callsign THAT THE control us TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT AN instruct IS direct TO ME AND NOT TO SOME OTHER pilot.
1653~ON september _ THE pushbackcrew CHIEF RAMP ask IF I WOULD LOOK AT A PANEL ON aircraft XYZ.ON THE righthand enginenumber _ FOUND THE engine PRESSURE RELIEF PANEL LOOSE AND _ AFT cable broke.I look AT THE surround area AND FOUND NO OTHER DAMAGE.check ADJACENT PANEL close AND secure PANEL.I inform pushbackcrew TO HOLD ON WHILE I WENT INSIDE TO check ON THE _ broke cable.I WENT IN AND inform MY crewchief AND WAS TOLD TO CONTACT aircraft maintenancetechnician.UPON inform aircraft TECHNICIAN I WAS inform THAT IT WAS A no go.I TOLD MY crewchief.HE TOLD ME TO GO INFORM CREW BUT aircraft WAS GONE.
1655~IT WAS lastday OF _ day pair.WE WERE ON THE _ OF _ leg.FATIGUE I FEEL WAS A FACTOR.approach control ask US TO KEEP OUR speedup.I WAS pilotnotflying firstofficer WAS pilotflying.WE WERE ABOVE _ knot AND HIGH WHEN clear FOR VISUAL.AS WE HAD BEEN discuss bestway TO GET DOWN TO THE SLOT _ feetabovegroundlevel spool AND ON glideslope ON PREVIOUS approach AND compare method I assume HE WOULD BE try A differ TECHNIQUE.BUT IN OUR approach descend checklist HE NEVER mention THAT SO I M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS hi INTENT.IT MAY HAVE BEEN FATIGUE ON hi PART.AS WE start TO CONFIGURE IT WAS APPARENT THAT OUR HIGH land weigh AND quarteringtailwind WERE work AGAINST US.I ask THE tower FOR sturn AS A LAST RESORT MANEUVER PRIOR TO go AROUND.AT THE TIME I WAS convince WE WOULD tower say YOU CAN HAVE runway THAT LL GIVE YOU AN EXTRA mile TO GET DOWN.WE agree TO DO THAT.THE problem WAS ANOTHER aircraft WAS ON SHORT FINAL AND WE WERE encroach ON HIM.IT work LIKE WE WERE go TO MAKE THE SLOT.I hear tower TELL precedingaircraft NO DELAY ON exit runway MAKE nextturnoff.AT THAT POINT I REFOCUSED ON THE touchdownzone AND ensure WE HAD GEAR DOWN APPROPRIATE speed ETC.IN THE FLARE I look DOWNFIELD TO SEE THE OTHER aircraft south TAIL STILL IN runway AREA.INSTEAD OF take ACTION AND initiate goaraound I wait FOR THE tower TO INSTRUCT US TO goaraound.HE NEVER DID.I DON T KNOW IF HE DIDN T NOTICE OR JUST LEFT IT UP TO US.WE touch DOWN AND stop WELL SHORT OF intersect OF aforemention aircraft.BY NOT insure THE firstofficer AND I WERE think THE SAME I M go TO SEE IF I CAN SLOW DOWN fast THIS WAY I allow _ OF US TO BE LEFT IN A TIGHT SIT.BY NOT take ACTION WHEN I SAW THE NEED BUT INSTEAD wait FOR other TO ACT I allow A LOSS OF runway separate TO OCCUR.THE frighten PART WAS THE SCENARIO lead UP TO THE EVENT WAS ALL TOO FAMILIAR.ANOTHER _ aircraft HAD AN ACCIDENT do ALMOST THE EXACT samething SMALL differ IN THE FINAL approach TO TOUCHDOWN BUT basic THE SAME._ pilot tire AND NOT be THE master OF THEIR OWN FATE.IN THE FUTURE I WILL NOT LET FATIGUE AND complacent SIT IN MY COCKPIT.
1662~flightcrew taxi OUT IN AN aircraft THAT HAD AN exist minimumequipmentlistitem maintain carryover PYLON FLAP FAULT.ON taxiout CREW notice THAT THE elevate AT LIMIT DID NOT ILLUMINATE DURING A flight control check.CREW contact maintain bywayof RADIO TO INQUIRE IF THIS WAS NORMAL WITH THE CURRENT maintain carryover ITEM.maintain research AND say WE HAD TO taxiback TO RAMP TO LET maintain DO A VISUAL check OF OUR elevate rang.THEY OKAYED IT AND sign THE LOGBOOK.flightcrew TOOK aircraft TO ont airport.AT THIS STATION DURING A discuss WITH THE maintenancecoordinator THE captain SELF decide THAT THE elevate AT LIMIT LIGHT need TO BE DEALT WITH individual us it OWN minimumequipmentlistitem.UPON try TO COMPLY WITH THIS minimumequipmentlistitem WE FOUND THE aircraft UNABLE TO MEET THE NECESSARY requirement FOR DISPATCH.flight WAS cancel.THE REASON FOR THIS report IS THAT THE flightcrew fly AN aircraft AT THE direct OF maintain THAT WE LATER FOUND TO BE ILLEGAL FOR DISPATCH us ALL apply minimumequipmentlistitem.
1663~ON taxiout WHEN merge INTO taxiway JUST PRIOR TO runway aircraft Y taxi FOR takeoff AT A VERY HIGH speed JUST miss hit US.I HAD TO SLAM ON THE brake TO AVOID HIM.HE NEVER slow DOWN.groundcontrol WAS notify AND THEY apologize.I ask IF aircraft Y HAD US IN SIGHT AND THE pilot say YES.I ask WHY HE DIDN T SLOW DOWN.NO ANSWER.WE WERE ALMOST blindside BY THE EGO OF THE aircraft Y pilot AND groundcontrol NOT advise US OF traffic.
1664~ON september _ I WAS give aircraft XYZ TO WORK ON.PREVIOUS SHIFT maintain HAD replace THE enginepressureratio transmit FOR A THROTTLE SPLIT problem AND HAD accomplish AN OVERNIGHT check.THE enginepressureratio transmit WAS install BUT need AN O RING ON THE SENSE LINE.MY PARTNER install THE O RING AND verify THAT THE NEW PART WAS install.I TOOK THE aircraft TO THE runuparea AND RAN THE engine AT THE powersetting AS PER THE maintain MANUAL.EVERYTHING check OUT AND I deliver THE aircraft TO THE GATE.THERE WAS NO signoff FOR THE install OF THE PART SO I HAD TO SIGN FOR THE remove AND replace OF THE enginepressureratio transmit WHICH I WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT.THERE WAS NO MENTION OF initiate A followup IN THE LOGBOOK.ALL OF THE OPEN item ON THE LOG PAGE WERE sign OFF SO I sign OFF THE airworthy.UNKNOWN TO ME THERE WAS A followup require FOR minimumequipmentlist _ THAT HAD TO BE DONE ON THE OVERNIGHT THAT WAS NOT DONE.I DID NOT check THE minimumequipmentlist STICKER ON THE LOGBOOK COVER BUT I assume THAT THE minimumequipmentlist WAS continue ON PREVIOUS SHIFT.THE CREW TOOK THE PLANE AND fly A COUPLE OF leg UNTIL THE DISCREPANCY WAS notice IN XXX.XXX comply WITH THE followup AND notify ZZZ maintain WHO IN TURN notify ME.I DID NOT INVESTIGATE THE minimumequipmentlist ON THE aircraft BEFORE sign THE aircraft airworthy BUT assume THAT THE PREVIOUS SHIFT HAD address WHATEVER maintain WAS require WHETHER IT WAS work ON THE system OR defer IT.
1666~AFTER obtain THE currentautomaticterminalinformationservice inform I radio ground AND request permit TO TAXI TO THE activerunway FOR takeoff.THE assignedrunway WAS UNFAMILIAR.I taxiedto THE assignedrunway AND inadvertent cross OVER THE HOLD SHORT bar.I mistake THE APRON AREA BEYOND THE HOLD SHORT bar FOR THE runuparea.THE control instruct ME TO immediate TAXI TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOLD SHORT bar OFF OF THE activerunway.AFTER MY flight I WENT TO THE control tower TO MEET THE control AND DISCUSS MY INADVERTENT MISTAKE.I learn FROM THE center THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE control TO SEND A PLANE ON SHORT FINAL ON A goaraound EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT ON THE PART OF THE runway WHERE THE PLANE WOULD LAND.I GOT confuse IN AN UNFAMILIAR PART OF THE airport AND thank TO AN ALERT control quick rectify THE SIT.
1674~I WAS notify BY THE supervise THAT AN aircraft WAS come TO ZZZ WITH AN inoperative stabilize TRIM MOTOR.I WAS NOT inform THAT THIS aircraft WAS A maintenanceferry.THE stabilize TRIM MOTOR WAS replace IN accord WITH THE maintain MANUAL.aircraft WAS dispatch WITHOUT AN airworthy RELEASE signoff.THE pilotincommand notice THE LOGBOOK DID NOT HAVE AN airworthy RELEASE SIGNATURE.AT THAT TIME maintain WAS notify AND AN airworthy RELEASE WAS issue.
1681~I pick UP aircraft XYZ A _ AT ZZZ ON AN origin flight.inspect AND REVIEW OF THE LOGBOOK show A writeup OF A DISCREPANCY WHICH WAS DULY correct AND sign OFF BY OUR maintain.THE DISCREPANCY WAS relate TO PITCH TRIM AND THE correctiveaction WAS replace A TRIM actuate.TODAY october _ I receive A CALL FROM on OF OUR pilot WHO pick UP THE aircraft FROM ME IN ZZZ inform ME THAT THE maintenancedepartment inform HIM THAT follow THE PARTICULAR TRIM REPAIR WORK THEY HAD DONE THE aircraft need A NEW airworthy RELEASE WHICH THEY forget TO ENTER IN THE LOGBOOK.consequent I fly AN aircraft WHICH WAS miss require airworthy RELEASE AND possible violate federalaviationregulation south unknown.
1683~THE groundcontrol HAD AN aircraft ON taxiway A.THE _ clear runway AND enter taxiway A.THE groundcontrol HAD ANOTHER aircraft ON taxiway A AND instruct THE _ TO getback BEHIND THE HOLD SHORT LINE.THE _ DID AS HE WAS TOLD WHICH PUT HIM BACK ON THE runway WITH traffic SHORT FINAL.
1686~AS A design pilotexaminer conduct A commercialpilot airplanemultiengineland flight TEST AT _ airport IN HOLLYWOOD flightlevel.THE pilotincommand WAS clear TO LAND ON runway.AFTER clear THE runway ON taxiway Q pilotincommand WAS clear TO taxiback TO THE RAMP bywayof taxiway D TO taxiway north AND HOLD SHORT OF runway.pilotincommand readback THE TAXI AND HOLD SHORT instruct AND continue TO TAXI.THE APPLICANT A commercialpilot fail THIS flight TEST AND THEN HAD A SECOND fail.WHILE taxi WE debrief hi perform regard THE _ flight test AND miss taxiway north continue taxi ON taxiway D cross runway hold SHORT OF runway ON taxiway left.WE believe THAT THE assign land runway WERE runway AND runway.AFTER sever minute AND observe sever aircraft LAND ON runway WE request clearance TO crossrunway runway._ groundcontrol ask US OUR locate ON THE airport AFTER WE reply THEY inform US OF A POSSIBLE runwayincursion AND suggest THAT WE READ ABOUT runwayincursion ON OUR local BULLETIN BOARD locate IN fixedbase operate office THEN clear US ACROSS runway bywayof taxiway left TO THE RAMP.
1700~AFTER land AT DEN runway WE exit AT highspeedtaxiway _.AS captain I WAS taxi AND notice A _ hold ON THE paralleltaxiway taxiway M TO MY left AND face north WITH it TAXI lightoff.WE transmit TWICE ON _ ground FOR instruct WITH NO respond.WE switch BACK TO tower WHO THEN TOLD US TO contactground ON _.THIS TIME ground answer AND start yell DID YOU SEE THAT _ YOU cutoff.AT THIS POINT I transmit THAT WE HAD call TWICE NO REPLY AND THAT THE _ appear TO BE hold posit.exit THE runway WITH NO instruct AND see THE stop _ TO MY left I turn right ONTO northbound taxiway M AND continue TO ATTEMPT TO CALL airtrafficcontrol.POSSIBLE block transmit cause US NOT TO HEAR airtrafficcontrol OR THEM NOT TO HEAR US.OTHER pilot MUST MAKE decision base ON A DYNAMIC SIT.airtrafficcontrol yell doe NOT HELP AND IS UNPROFESSIONAL AND UNFAIR AS pilot CANNOT RESPOND.WE ALWAYS LOSE IN A VERBAL BATTLE WITH airtrafficcontrol.
1703~WE HAD JUST complete A revenueflight AND HAD unload OUR passenger AT THE GATE.control instruct US TO TAXI bywayof taxiway A TO taxiway north TO HOLD SHORT OF runway.WE DID SO AND HELD SHORT OF runway FOR approximate _ minute.IT WAS OBVIOUS THE groundcontrol forget ABOUT US SO WE remind HIM THAT WE WERE hold SHORT.THERE WAS _ aircraft ON A LONG FINAL TO WHAT appear TO US TO BE runway.THE control CAME BACK WITH SOMETHING LIKE crossrunway runway and right TO THE RAMP.MY firstofficer readback ROGER crossrunway runway and right.WE expedite ACROSS runway and right utilize OUR STANDARD crewresourcemanagement procedure AS WE approach EACH runwayholdline OF confirm WITH EACH OTHER THAT WE WERE clear TO CROSS AND clear left AND right WHILE visual scan THE depart arrive path.WHEN WE WERE _ WAY ACROSS runway THE groundcontrol WHO I BELIEVE WAS ALSO work THE towerfrequency AT THAT latehour query aircraft X ARE YOU hold SHORT runway.THEN CAME BACK WITH EXPEDITE ACROSS THERE south traffic ON SHORT FINAL TO runway.WHEN WE WERE safe ACROSS I state THAT MY firstofficer HAD readback THE clearance TO CROSS BOTH runway.WE WERE TOLD TO CALL THE tower WHICH WE DID AFTER secure THE aircraft FOR THE NIGHT.WHEN I call THE tower THE groundcontrol apologize AND say THAT HE realize THAT HE HAD fail TO CORRECT THE READBACK AFTER HE RAN DOWN AND listen TO THE tape OF THE radiotransmission.HE state THAT hi originalclearance WAS TO crossrunway runway AND HOLD SHORT OF runway AND THAT THE firstofficer readback TO CROSS BOTH runway AND THAT HE NEVER CAUGHT THE ERROR.I DON T BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS ani SERIOUS LOSS OF separate IN THIS INCIDENT AS THE land traffic WAS STILL sever mile OUT ON FINAL WHICH WE confirm BY do A VISUAL check BEFORE cross.factor WHICH contribute TO THIS BREAKDOWN IN safe include THE tower south origin unclear transmit WHICH BOTH THE firstofficer AND MYSELF misunderstand AS WELL AS THE control south fail TO GET THE STANDARD HOLD SHORT READBACK require WHEN ask TO HOLD SHORT OF A runway.I BELIEVE THAT A safe procedure WOULD INVOLVE require VERBAL confirm FOR cross EVERY runway ALTHOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE AT A busyairport LIKE stl airport WHERE frequencycongestion ON THE RADIO IS AN add problem.PERHAPS AN altern IDEA TO IMPROVE safe ON THE ground WOULD BE A STOP GO lightsystem FOR clearance TO CROSS AT EVERY taxiway activerunway intersect alleviate THE NEED FOR RADIO communicate ALTOGETHER.
1704~_ X clear runway AT taxiway _.call groundcontrol.groundcontrol TOLD _ TO GET BEHIND HOLD SHORT LINE FOR traffic ON taxiway A._ turn BACK ON taxiway _ AND runway AND turn AROUND TO HOLD SHORT OF taxiway A TO LET beechjet Z PASS.traffic AT TIME OF occur WAS A FALCON Y turn ABOUT _ mile right BASE FOR runway.control involve NEITHER coordinate WITH local control NOR understand THAT A runwayincursion HAD happen.
1705~WE WERE ON THE RAMP clear TO TAXI TO runway _.I WAS run THE TAXI AND BEFORE takeoffchecklist rare look OUT TO SEE THE PROGRESS OF THE TAXI.AS I GOT TO item THAT I COULD NOT COMPLETE UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE takeoff I look UP AND slow realize WE WERE taxi ON THE activerunway.BEFORE I COULD SAY ANYTHING THE pilotflying state THAT IT look LIKE WE inadvertent taxi ONTO A runway AND TO INFORM airtrafficcontrol.THEIR respond WAS TO CONTINUE backtaxi TO THE END OF THE runway.NOTHING ELSE WAS say ABOUT THE INCURSION.contribute factor WERE THE pilotflying south unfamiliar WITH THE airport airportdiagram WAS NOT review I DIDN T MONITOR THE TAXI PROGRESS AS CLOSE AS I SHOULD HAVE.correctiveaction WOULD INCLUDE pilotnotflying monitor OUTSIDE DURING PROGRESS OF THE TAXI consult OF THE airportdiagram BY pilotflying AND ASK FOR progressivetaxiinstructions FROM ground.
1715~WE ARE A _ CARRIER.MY firstofficer AND I report FOR DUTY AT rdu airport AT approximate _.IT WAS DARK AND OUR aircraft WAS AT THE GATE WITH THE auxiliarypowerunit operate.WE HAVE CONTRACT maintain IN rdu airport AND I WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE PLANE HAD BEEN tow TO THE GATE FROM THE HANGAR AS IT WAS park IN it USUAL OVERNIGHT park locate.MY firstofficer perform THE EXTERNAL preflight AND I perform THE INTERIOR firstflight OF THE DAY accept check.IT WAS DARK OUTSIDE BUT MY firstofficer WAS us A FLASHLIGHT.HE DID NOT report ANYTHING ABNORMAL.AFTER takeoff AND DURING climbout EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL.WE level OFF AT flightlevelenroute TO bos airport.AS WE begin OUR descend WE accelerate THROUGH approximate MACH _ AND I feel A slightvibration.I THOUGHT WE MAY HAVE pick UP A LITTLE ICE IN THE climbout SO I slow TO approximate MACH _ AND THE vibrate stop.THE remain OF THE flight WAS NORMAL.AFTER park IN bos airport AND deplane passenger MY firstofficer perform A postflight exteriorinspection.HE inform ME THAT THE aircraft WAS damage.I exit THE aircraft AND notice THAT THE left WINGLET WAS damage AND distort.I notify OUR COMPANY.A FEW day LATER I receive A TELEPHONE CALL FROM OUR VICE PRESIDENT OF safe.HE inform ME THAT THE employee OF THE maintenancefacility apparent pull OUR aircraft OUT OF THE maintenancehangar AND drag OUR WINGLET ACROSS THE UNDERSIDE OF A JETSTREAM cause substantialdamage TO THE JETSTREAM.THEY BELIEVE SINCE THE CANADAIR WAS be tow STRAIGHT IT lift THE JETSTREAM AND DID DAMAGE TO THE TOP OF OUR WINGLET.WHEN WE start OUR descend THE AIRFLOW STRUCK THE damage TOP OF THE WINGLET cause IT TO COME APART.
1717~land ON runway _ exit ON taxiway left OR K.tower say TO STAY WITH THEM FOR TAXI.I say THAT I WAS UNFAMILIAR AND need progress TO generalaviation.THEY TOLD ME TO TAXI west AND LOOK FOR THE firestation.I taxi PAST THE STATION COULDN T SEE IT AND WENT PAST THE HOLD SHORT LINE FOR runway _.control say YOU ARE ON runway _ DO _ degree AND RETURN TO THE firestation.HE THEN GAVE ME VERY ACCURATE assist TO generalaviation.factor INCLUDE pilot south UNFAMILIAR WITH airport AT NIGHT.control NOT pay attention TO MY TAXI AS I request.
1727~THE automaticweatherobservingreportingsystem BROADCAST GAVE wind favor runway _.THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequency WAS SO crowd THAT transmit WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND.THE WINDSOCK WAS show winddirection vary BUT I THINK STILL favor runway _.I MADE BLIND call ON DOWNWIND BASE AND FINAL FOR runway _ AND hear NO OTHER TRAFFIC.I land MADE THE firstturnoff AND THEN SAW A TRIPACER THAT HAD land ON _ turn OFF THE FAR END OF THE runway.MY approachcontrol WAS show BEACON AND strobe WAS NO light ON THE PIPER.discuss WITH FUEL PERSONNEL reveal WHAT THEY SAW NOT AN unusualoccurrence AT MJX AND IN FACT happen AGAIN DURING THE approximate _ minute I WAS THERE.suggest correctiveaction CHECK CALIBRATION OF automaticweatherobservingreportingsystem WIND SENSOR.install OF WIND TEE TO INDICATE activerunway.CHANGE commontrafficadvisoryfrequency TO LESS congestedfrequency.MAKE addition FREQUENCY avail FOR commontrafficadvisoryfrequency._ _ _ _ _ _ report DID NOT REVEAL ani NEW inform.
1728~DURING TAXI FOR depart FROM bos airport airport WE fail TO STOP AT OUR assign TAXI POINT.WE WERE park ON THE generalaviation RAMP NEXT TO taxiway K.THE groundcontrol TOLD US TO FOLLOW AN _ TO THE BRAVO HOLD POINT.I WAS NOT SURE WHERE THE BRAVO HOLD POINT WAS EVEN THOUGH I WAS look AT THE airportdiagram.THEN ground clear AN AIRBUS OFF OUR left WING TO FOLLOW US SO I TOLD THE copilot TO FOLLOW THE _ WHILE I look FOR THE BRAVO HOLD POINT.unfortunate THE HOLD POINT WAS VERY CLOSE TO WHERE WE start OUR TAXI AND THE towercontroller WE WERE monitor inform US WE HAD miss THE HOLD POINT.THE towercontroller switch US TO ANOTHER towercontroller AFTER give US taxiinstruction TO runway _.IT WAS A MISTAKE TO EVER MOVE THE aircraft WITHOUT know exact WHERE WE WERE go BUT I DIDN T WANT TO INTERFERE WITH THE FLOW OF depart NOR BOTHER A VERY BUSY groundcontrol.I THOUGHT I WOULD easy FIND THE HOLD POINT BEFORE WE reach IT.MY EFFORT TO LOCATE THE POINT WAS slow BY ME accomplish NUMEROUS TAXI check.IN THE FUTURE I WON T MOVE UNTIL ALL taxiinstruction AND clearance ARE locate AND I AM go TO ADJUST THE checklist SO ONLY THE check THAT HAVE TO BE DONE taxi ARE accomplish.THIS WILL ENABLE ME TO PUT _ percent OF MY EFFORT INTO taxi.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ IN RETROSPECT I THINK WE assume THE aircraftjet WAS ALSO go TO HOLD AT THE BRAVO HOLD POINT SO WE follow HIM AND continue WITH THE BEFORE takeoff check INSTEAD OF maintain A watch EYE TO airportmarking.
1732~WHILE ON A continuousduty TRIP TO ZZZ UPON reach aircraft FOR THE morn RETURN flight TO cvg airport I discover THAT THE integrateddrivegenerator integrateddrivegenerator HAD BEEN defer THE previousnight DUE TO AN integrateddrivegenerator CAUTION MESSAGE.THE previouscrew HAD perform THE QRH procedure WHICH include disconnect OF THE integrateddrivegenerator FOR THE number _ engine.THE integrateddrivegenerator WAS defer I DON T KNOW BY WHOM maintain control PER THE PROPER minimumequipmentlist _ BUT THE WRONG subpart OF THE minimumequipmentlist WAS us WHICH IS PART B WHICH refer TO THE generate PORTION OF THE integrateddrivegenerator.THE system SHOULD HAVE BEEN defer BY _ subpart A WHICH refer TO THE constantspeed DRIVE PORTION OF THE integrateddrivegenerator.I review THE minimumequipmentlist AND refer THE _ flightstandard MANUAL FOR THE minimumequipmentlist _ operate procedure AS WELL AS THE _ OTHER minimumequipmentlist south ON THIS.unfortunate I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE WRONG subpart OF THE minimumequipmentlist WAS us.inflight I review THE minimumequipmentlist AGAIN WITH THE firstofficer AND realize THE ERROR.THE firstofficer HAD mention AFTER PUSHBACK THAT HE THOUGHT THE subpart B OF THE minimumequipmentlist MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONG.WE review THE system AND determine THAT AT THAT POINT THE minimumequipmentlist WAS PROPER.I BELIEVE THE contribute factor TO this situate WERE THE HIGH NUMBER OF minimumequipmentlist south FOR THIS aircraft A VERY HIGH NUMBER OF minimumequipmentlist south IS COMMON FOR OUR FLEET THE IMPROPER defer OF THIS ITEM BY maintain control WHICH WE ARE see A LOT OF.
1737~aircraft WAS load WITH FREIGHT BEFORE FIRST LIGHT.AFTER start engine I HAD TO MAKE _ degree TURN TO LEAVE THE parkingarea.I maneuver AROUND A park FALCON _ THEN proceed TOWARD THE taxiway.IN A DARK PART OF THE RAMP I feel AN IMPACT AND shutdown THE engine THEN discover I HAD HIT A park _.I BELIEVE I DIDN T SEE IT BECAUSE OF THE DARK CONDITION OF THE RAMP AND THE light AREA BEYOND THE park AIRPLANE.
1742~captain DID NOT HEAR HOLD SHORT instruct.groundcontrol GAVE TAXI south runway _ C HOLD SHORT runway _.WE HAD A takeoff plan FOR runway _ I acknowlege instruct AND inquire ABOUT runway _.groundcontrol acknowledge ROGER _.AS WE TAXIIED I WAS consult THE AIRFIELD DIAGRAM.I look UP AND realize WE HAD cross A HOLD SHORT LINE.realize IT WAS FOR runway _ NOT mark WITH runway identify UNIQUE SETUP.MADE left TURN cross A HOLD SHORT LINE realize IT WAS FOR runway _ notice A BEECH _ IN posit AND HOLD.ask captain WHERE HE plan TO STOP AND HE stop noseover HOLD SHORT LINE.I advise ground WE WERE OVER HE acknowledge AND say FINE HOLD THERE AND clear THE BEECH FOR takeoff._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report say THAT THERE ARE TWO HOLD SHORT line THAT ARE IN goodcondition AND VISIBLE BUT THAT THEY ARE connect TOGETHER AND AT ABOUT FORTY FIVE DEGREE angle WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF THE runway _ AND runway _ LAYOUT.THERE IS NO SIGNAGE AS TO WHAT PART OF THE LINE apply TO WHICH runway AND THAT lead TO confuse.
1743~I WAS TOLD TO TAXI TO THE ORANGE cone THAT WERE AT THE HOLD SHORT LINE FOR runway _.I WENT ABOUT _ feet BEYOND THE ORANGE cone AND immediate stop THE PLANE AND call ground.ground TOLD ME TO DO _ degree TURN AND taxiback BEHIND THE cone.I DID THIS AND WAS TOLD TO CALL THE tower SOMETIME THAT AFTERNOON.I call THE tower ABOUT _ hour AFTER AND WAS TOLD BY THE tower manage THAT I WAS THE _ PERSON IN THE LAST hour THAT HAD SOME SORT OF TAXI problem AT THE airport.THERE WAS construct WORK go ON AT THE airport AND THERE WERE MANY ORANGE cone ALL OVER THE taxiway.I person FEEL THAT IF THEY ARE go TO us ORANGE cone AS HOLD SHORT LINE THEY SHOULD BE A differ COLOR AS THERE WERE ABOUT _ ORANGE cone IN THE AREA ALSO keep IN MIND THAT _ OTHER pilot DID THE samething.
1746~IN THE PROCESS OF start TO UPGRADE ALL FLEET south enhance groundproximitywarningsystem enhance groundproximitywarningsystem computer TO XXX I note COMPANY PART NUMBER ABCX HAD _ manufacture south PART number yyy airport OR ZZZ.TELEX FROM BOEING state yyy airport WAS NEVER certify ON _.FURTHER RESEARCH show _ ONLY certify WITH yyy airport._ ONLY certify WITH ZZZ.AFTER discuss WITH INVENTORY ON remove yyy airport FROM THE COMPANY PART number I WAS go TO RELEASE MANUAL alert TO THE _ AND _ fleet TO PREVENT INCORRECT unit be install ON THE aircraft.I decide TO VERIFY THE aircraft WERE correct configure BY issue AN ALERT ON october _ WHILE review THE _ ALERT _ aircraft WERE FOUND INCORRECT.
1748~ON A visualflightrules FROM dvt airport TO lvk airport AT approximate _ I land AT _ airport FOR FUEL.I taxiedto THE fuel AREA TO ADD FUEL TO MY aircraft FROM THE _ FUEL DISPENSER.AFTER fuel MY aircraft I push BACK AWAY FROM THE _ FUEL DISPENSER GOT INTO MY AIRPLANE start THE engine AND start TO TAXI FROM THE fuel AREA TO runway _ FOR depart TO lvk airport.AT THIS TIME ABOUT _ I collide WITH THE JET A FUEL DISPENSER damage THE aircraft propel AND engine.MY aircraft IS A TAILWHEEL low TYPE AIRPLANE WITH VERY limit forwardvisibility WHEN maneuver OR taxi ON THE ground.I FEEL THAT THE VERY LOW posit AND locate TO THE ground OF THIS JET A FUEL DISPENSER AND NO sign OR PROMINENT mark AND NO taxiway centerline mark IN THIS AREA WAS A contribute FACTOR TO THIS INCIDENT AND present A HAZARD TO aircraft maneuver OR taxi IN THIS fuel AREA.I SUGGEST BETTER identify OR PROMINENT mark OF THE JET A FUEL DISPENSER AREA AND centerline TAXI mark IN THIS AREA.

1873~AN AEROBATIC COMPETITION IS be HELD AT MARANA include A GLIDER CATEGORY.GULFSTREAM Z call ask FOR trafficadvisory.AT THAT TIME THERE WERE NO advisory.moment LATER GLIDER Y WHICH WAS IN THE AEROBATIC BOX ON A differentfrequency call DOWNWIND.GULFSTREAM Z call sound confuse AND frustrate NOT understand WHERE traffic WAS.GULFSTREAM Z THEN call DOWNWIND.GLIDER Y THEN call BASE.AGAIN GULFSTREAM Z sound confuse AND frustrate.HE state HE DOESN T HAVE GLIDER Y IN SIGHT.ask GLIDER Y WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GUYS do.GLIDER Y call FINAL AND state WILL BE ON runway FOR _ second AFTER stop.GULFSTREAM Z call FINAL AND state YOU GUYS.AFTER land GLIDER Y remain stop ON THE runway AND WAIVES THE towplane X TO TOW THEM backup.I pull OUT ONTO THE runway THEY GOT hook UP AND WE WERE roll IN LESS THEN _ second.unfortunate DURING THAT TIME GULFSTREAM Z WENT AROUND.GLIDER Y WAS OFF frequency origin WHILE IN THE AEROBATIC BOX DURING THE INITIAL CALL FROM THE GULFSTREAM.THE GULFSTREAM pilot appear TO HAVE NO RESPECT FOR GLIDER Y AND THAT THE GLIDER Y HAD THE RIGHT OF WAY.ALSO EITHER MYSELF OR THE LINE CHIEF OR GLIDER Y pilot need TO BE IN CHARGE AND BROADCAST MORE inform intent.announce GLIDER Y WOULD BE ON THE runway FOR sever moment WAS NOT ENOUGH.intent WERE A STOP AND GO ON THE runway AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN announce THAT WAY.OTHER similarincident occur THIS WEEKEND WHERE I WASN T involve.I BELIEVE THE SOLUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE on OTHER PERSON involve THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF traffic DURING GLIDER operate WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH THIS airport.LINE CHIEF WAS BUSY do TOO MANY thing._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report note THAT HIGH trafficvolume DURING THE COMPETITION contribute TO THE INCIDENT AND suggest THAT implement OF A temporarytower DURING period OF HIGH OR SPECIAL ACTIVITY WOULD significant REDUCE THE frequency AND sever OF THESE kind OF conflict.
1875~I WAS make THE VERY shorttaxi FROM GATE TO runway IN sit.I WAS push TO GET THE checklist finish WHEN ground TOLD US clear ONTO runway _ FOR fulllength.I WAS look AND respond TO THE checklist AND DID NOT NOTICE WE WERE STILL ON groundcontrol.WHAT I THOUGHT I hear WAS clear ONTO runway FOR fulllength.THERE WAS AN aircraft sit ON runway JUST power UP FOR takeoff AND I wrong assume I WAS TO DO THE samething.THERE WAS NOT A HOLD SHORT OF runway.I simple hear THE clear ONTO runway PART AND mistake runway _ FOR runway.MY BAD.THE firstofficer WAS headsdown read THE checklist AND HAD NO IDEA WE WERE SO CLOSE.AS SOON AS HE look UP HE yell BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.ABOUT _ feet OF MY JET WAS ON THE runway.THERE WAS A generalaviation aircraft ON FINAL.look LIKE A GRUMMAN travel.THE GRUMMAN WAS KIND OF HIGH SO I DIDN T SEE HIM FROM MY SIDE OF THE COCKPIT.HE WAS TOLD TO goaraound AT FIRST BUT THEN clear TO LAND LONG.THE GRUMMAN pass WELL ABOVE US AND land AROUND THE LAST _ OF THE runway.HAD I notice WE WERE STILL ON groundcontrol I WOULD NOT HAVE taxi ONTO THE activerunway.HAD I NOT BEEN push THROUGH THE checklist I WOULD NOT HAVE taxi ONTO THE activerunway.HAD I NOT hear THE clear ONTO OR hear HOLD SHORT I WOULD NOT HAVE taxi ONTO THE activerunway.
1876~request progressivetaxi FROM groundcontrol DUE TO airport unfamiliar.clearance WAS TO TURN left ON taxiway C AND HOLD SHORT runway _.WHILE taxi I divert MY attention TO SET navigate radio TO MATCH OUR departureclearance.AS I look UP THE STUDENT WAS cross A runway.I ask THE STUDENT WHICH runway AND SHE reply THAT SHE HAD clear THE AREA PRIOR TO cross BUT DID NOT KNOW WHICH runway IT WAS.examine OF THE airportdiagram reveal IT WAS runway _.I HAD THE STUDENT STOP turnaround AND counsel HER ON THE import OF read airport sign AND mark.I contact groundcontrol TO apology AND EXPLAIN THE SIT.TO AVOID THIS occur IN THE FUTURE I LL MAINTAIN attention OUTSIDE THE AIRPLANE WHEN IN MOTION.NO trafficconflict occur.
1881~WHILE troubleshoot A wire problem IN THE fuelquantity system OF aircraft XYZ I inadvertent swap THE electric connector ON THE number _ AND number _ tank fuelquantity indicator AT THE flightengineer south STATION.THE connector WERE NOT clear mark THUS THE mixup.WHILE inflight THE problem WAS discover AND correct UPON arrive IN XXX.THE fuelquantity system NOW operate normal.IF I HAD remove THE electric connector on AT A TIME THERE WOULDN T HAVE BEEN THE mixup.
1882~ON november _ aircraft XYZ arrive IN ZZZ WITH THE refuel PANEL fuelquantity indicate system ON maintain defer.THE fuelquantity system WAS ON defer DUE TO circuitbreaker _ fuel gauge pop.WHILE try TO FUEL THE aircraft addition circuitbreaker begin TO POP.I begin TO TROUBLESHOOT THE system BY replace circuitbreaker _ AND relay _ AND _.replace THESE component DID NOT CORRECT THE problem.I THEN begin TO check INDIVIDUAL wire.I FOUND cannonplug _ WHICH HAD BEEN ti BACK AND cap DURING A PREVIOUS fuelquantity modify short AND burn.THIS CONNECTOR pose A FIRE AND safetyhazard.TO CORRECT THE problem I remove THE PLUG cap AND stow THE wire.THE fuelsystem include QUANTITY begin TO OPERATE normal.I report TO _ maintenancecoordinator MR X WHAT I HAD DONE.HE ALONG WITH LIAISON engineer inform ME THAT SINCE THIS PLUG HAD NOT BEEN us IN A NUMBER OF year IT WAS ALRIGHT TO REMOVE THE PLUG.I THEN defer THE remove PLUG FOR LATER REPAIR OR DELETION FROM system.I WAS UNDER THE impress THAT write approve TO REMOVE PLUG WAS NOT require.I KNOW NOW THAT write approve IN THE FORM OF AN engineer REPAIR author WAS require.I REALIZE THAT THIS WAS AN unauthorized modify TO AN aircraft system.THE remove OF THIS PLUG AND THE terminate OF THE aircraft wire DID NOT DEGRADE THE safe OR INTEGRITY OF THE aircraft AND it system.THE _ wire DIAGRAM _ PAGE _ clear SHOWAS THAT PLUG _ WAS NO long IN us AND HAD BEEN ti BACK.THIS PLUS IS locate IN THE right WING leadingedge AND IS SUBJECT TO contaminate.
1885~WE begin OUR TAXI AT bna airport AND I call groundcontrol approach SPOT X.WE WERE clear TO runway _ AND TOLD TO HOLD AT THE instrumentlandingsystem HOLD SHORT LINE.I acknowledge THAT WE WERE clear TO runway _.AS WE approach THE instrumentlandingsystem HOLD SHORT LINE I advise THE captain WE WERE instruct TO HOLD SHORT OF THE instrumentlandingsystem LINE.HE say instrumentlandingsystem approach WERE NOT IN us AND WE COULD us THE runway HOLD SHORT LINE.I THEN advise HIM THE groundcontrol specific TOLD US TO STOP AT THE instrumentlandingsystem HOLD SHORT LINE.HE THEN stop THE AIRPLANE ABOUT _ feet BEYOND THE instrumentlandingsystem HOLD SHORT LINE.THE towercontroller advise US THAT BECAUSE WE cross THE instrumentlandingsystem HOLD SHORT LINE THEY MADE aircraft Y CHANGE FROM runway _ TO runway.AFTER receive THE taxiclearance THE captain say OK.WE DID NOT specific DISCUSS instrumentlandingsystem HOLD SHORT LINE VERSUS runway HOLD SHORT LINE.WITH THE weather be clearsky AND _ plus mile visible IT IS UNUSUAL TO STOP AT THE instrumentlandingsystem HOLD SHORT LINE.I THINK THAT IS WHY THE captain WAS think runway HOLD SHORT LINE.IN THE FUTURE WHEN instruct TO us TO instrumentlandingsystem HOLD SHORT LINE special DURING goodweather I WILL report THE clearance TO THE captain AND WAIT FOR hi respond SIMILAR TO AN altitudeclearance.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ I WAS PAST MY assign POINT BUT SINCE I WAS SO FAR BACK FROM THE HOLD SHORT LINE I WAS AND AM mystify AS TO WHY THE _ ON FINAL WASN T allow TO PROCEED TO A runway _ land.IN MY MIND I WAS go TO GO TO THE HOLD SHORT LINE BECAUSE THE weather WAS clear.I assume THAT THE TAXI WAS clear ALL THE WAY TO THE runway.add TO MY MENTAL HEAP WAS THAT IN MY EXPERIENCE AT bna airport I HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN instruct TO HOLD AT THAT PARTICULAR approach LINE SPOT.AS I approach THE approach LINE MY firstofficer inform ME THAT I WAS suppose TO STOP AT IT.
1892~flight DRO DEN WE taxi OUT.MADE TAXI TO runway CALL ON aeronauticaladvisorystationfrequency _.REPLY FROM CARAVAN THAT HE WAS turn FINAL runway _.WE complete OUR checklist.gain OUR CLEARANCE FROM DENVER CENTER FOR depart.I HAD THE firstofficer ON THE right SIDE OF THE aircraft visual CLEAR THE runway approximate _ minute HAD lapse SINCE THE OTHER aircraft HAD call turn FINAL.WE HAD hear NO OTHER transmit SINCE WE WERE TO DEPART runway _.IT WAS DUSK DARK THE firstofficer reply THE runway WAS CLEAR.I ask THE firstofficer TO transmit THAT WE WERE depart runway _ AT DRO.HE DID NO IMMEDIATE REPLY THEN AS WE WERE taxi OUT WE hear runway _ land.IT WAS A WEAK garble transmit THAT I THOUGHT WAS AT A differentairport.HOWEVER SINCE WE early HAD conflictingtraffic I ask THE firstofficer TO CHECK AGAIN THAT THE runway WAS CLEAR.HE DID AND say IT WAS CLEAR.AS AN EXTRA PRECAUTION I HAD HIM AGAIN CALL THAT WE WERE depart runway _ AT DRO.ABOUT THIS TIME WE ARE taxi INTO posit.I HAD clear THE left SIDE OF THE runway AS WE turn right INTO posit AND HOLD I look intent DOWN THE runway.ALL THE light I SAW look LIKE THEY WERE PART OF THE runwayenvironment.THERE WAS NO STROBE AND NO land LIGHT THAT WOULD IDENTIFY AN aircraft ON THE runway.IN respond TO OUR SECOND takeoff CALL WE hear HEY WAIT A MINUTE I M STILL roll OUT.come FROM THE CARAVAN pilot.I immediate turn THE aircraft BACK TO THE HOLD SHORT AREA AND exit THE runway.AFTER HE WAS CLEAR I advise HIM hi transmit appear TO BE WEAK.WE depart normal.factor _.uncontrolledairport DRO need A TOWER WITH THE AMOUNT OF traffic BOTH THERE AND ANIMAS FIELD _ nauticalmile AWAY story OF NUMEROUS conflict._.TIME OF DAY DUSK DARK VISUAL ACUITY MAY BE it weak.light OF THE CARAVAN WERE NOT distinguish FROM THE runwayenvironment AT THAT DISTANCE._.instrumentflightrulesclearance THERE IS A CERTAIN urgent TO GET AIRBORNE quick AFTER get YOUR instrumentflightrulesclearance.THIS IS constant imply BY CENTER ask HOW SOON TILL YOU WILL BE OFF._.CESSNA CARAVAN BOTH THE light AND transmit ON THIS CARAVAN APPEAR WEAK._.CARAVAN pilot MADE TOO FEW OF call IN BLIND AS TO WHERE HE WAS ON approach._.crewresourcemanagement firstofficer WAS DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH ON TRIP AT time initiate checklist BEFORE THEY WERE call FOR WEAK OR IMPROPER intracockpit communicate.DIFFICULT TO BUILD TEAM CONCEPT.firstofficer want TO RUSH MAY HAVE NOT SET PROPER ATMOSPHERE.I SHOULD HAVE BETTER brief HIM AND demand STANDARD practice._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report stress IT SHOULD BE mandate THAT THE aeronauticaladvisorystationcommontrafficadvisoryfrequency frequency BE man DURING BUSY hour AT ALL UNCONTROLLED airport WHERE THERE IS A GOOD MIX OF traffic.report ALSO say THAT HE HAS try sever time TO UTILIZE hi trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem II TO PICK UP OTHER traffic WHILE ON THE GROUND AT DRO BUT BECAUSE OF THE highterrain IT HAS BEEN USELESS.
1901~aircraft WOULD NOT MAINTAIN pressurize.outflowvalve FULL close.left PACK WAS minimumequipmentlist ED AIR WAS leak OUT THROUGH THE PACK OR SO THEY THOUGHT.CABIN continue TO climb AT _ FPM.WE return TO dtw airport.
1903~GOOD preflight plan.GOOD BRIEF.I WAS fly WITH A captain I KNOW AND LIKE AND RESPECT A LOT.WHEN push BACK IN NIGHT lowvisibility WE WERE issue A clearance TO HOLD SHORT runway AT taxiway G TO WATCH FOR ANOTHER CARRIER push AT sametime.captain brief OUR NORMAL HABIT rout OF TAXI AND WE SAW WHAT WE believe WAS OUR traffic TO FOLLOW AND captain act LIKE HE know rout BUT OUR normaltaxi rout WAS THE wrongway NOT OUR clear rout.I fail TO BACK HIM UP BECAUSE WHILE look AT PAGE _ I DID NOT VERIFY THAT rout clear.WE turn ONTO wrongtaxiway AND groundcontrol notice THAT RIGHT AWAY.WE HAD GONE OUR NORMAL expect rout BUT NOT OUR clear rout.expect BIAS humanfactor.crosscockpit author BIAS humanfactor.AFTER INCIDENT captain DID A goodjob OF debrief AND NOT allow SUBSEQUENT fail MODE DUE TO fixate.WE HAD posit UNTIL WE COULD CROSS TO OUR new clear rout.I BELIEVE pilot SHOULD QUESTION EVERY clearance.WHAT IS need IS ground SURVEILLANCE WITH precis ground RADAR PLUS A light track system LIKE I VE see IN AN AVIATION MAGAZINE.
1907~groundcontrol clear ME TO TAXI TO runway FOR takeoff.BECAUSE THE control south attention WAS divert TO assist A pilot WHO COULD NOT FIND THE runuparea FOR runway progress instruct WERE NOT avail.I posit THE aircraft IN WHAT I believe WAS THE runuparea FOR runway point THE NOSE AT THE tower _ degree activate THE parkingbrake AND start perform preflight takeoffchecklist.ABOUT _ second INTO checklist groundcontrol instruct ME TO immediate PERFORM left TURN AND reposition THE aircraft DUE TO POSSIBLE pilot divers INTO runwayenvironment.I immediate pull FORWARD AND DID A _ degree TURN TO THE left make IT DIFFICULT TO LATER ASCERTAIN precis WHERE ani aircraft HAD BEEN previous posit.HOWEVER IT appear MY right WINGTIP approximate _ feet MAY HAVE extend OVER THE runway BOUNDARY LINE.IF SO THE aircraft WAS STILL _ feet AWAY FROM THE runway ITSELF.THE GEOMETRY OF THE runway BOUNDARY line IN relate TO THE taxiway AND runuparea IS potential confuse DUE TO THE OBLIQUE angle.SEE DIAGRAM attach ANOTHER POTENTIAL FACTOR WAS THE SPLIT duty OF THE groundcontrol AND _ runway control.I WAS TOLD BY on control THE OTHER WAS concern HE HAD clear ME ONTO runway DUE TO ME be potential tune TO wrongfrequency IE potential talk TO control FOR runway NOT runway.WHILE NO LOSS OF separate OR ACTUAL runwayincursion occur ANOTHER aircraft WAS order TO goaraound.
1908~I start THE engine AS A rate pilot pilotflying leftseat IN accord WITH companystandardoperatingprocedure.I WAS list AS secondincommand FOR THE flight.THE pilotincommand pilotnotflying WAS IN THE rightseat.HE announce OUR INTENT TO TAXI TO runway _ FOR depart.prevail WIND WAS report AS _.KTRK HAS _ runway _ _ feet AND _ _ feet.AS WE clear THE mainramp AREA I call FOR THE TAXI BEFORE takeoffchecklist.WE AS A CREW begin run THE checklist.AS WE approach THE intersect OF _ WHICH IS approximate _ feet FROM THE THRESHOLD OF runway _ I look TO CLEAR runway _ AND SAW NOTHING.I THEN look TO CLEAR runway _ AFTER WHICH I WAS distract BY A COMMENT BY THE pilotincommand.I DID NOT LOOK BACK TO runway _ NOR DID I ANNOUNCE THE runway CLEAR AS WE cross THE intersect.AT approximate THAT TIME THE pilotincommand state HE WAS go TO OAKLAND center TO GET OUR instrumentflightrules CLRANCE.AT SOME POINT HE switch FROM aeronauticaladvisorystation TO center frequency ON THE number _ RADIO WHICH I HAD BEEN monitor.WHEN HE call MONITOR number _ RADIO FOR aeronauticaladvisorystation WE WERE THROUGH THE intersect AND ON THE taxiway TO runway _.I THEN hear OUR tailnumber ON THE aeronauticaladvisorystation AND A pilot assert THAT THERE HAD BEEN A NEAR collide.I look BACK AS BEST MY FIELD OF VIEW WOULD ALLOW BUT STILL DID NOT SEE HIM.HE WAS ALSO demand THE NAME OF THE pilotincommand.AFTER THE pilotincommand HAD receive THE instrumentflightrulesclearance HE rejoin ME IN monitor THE aeronauticaladvisorystationfrequency.I explain WHAT WAS say AND THE REQUEST FROM THE OTHER pilot.THE pilotincommand reply THAT HE WOULD NOT REVEAL hi NAME AS PER companypolicy.THE OTHER PILOT WAS BELLIGERENT AND AFTER THE pilotincommand south REFUSAL TO GIVE hi NAME threaten FAR ACTION.THE pilotincommand THEN question ME AS TO WHAT I SAW.I TOLD HIM I HAD look BOTH way AND SAW NOTHING.THE pilotincommand HAD BEEN headsdown IN THE COCKPIT DURING THE approach AND cross OF THE _ intersect.AFTER WE level IN CRUISE flight THE pilotincommand ask OUR flightattendant WHO IS ALSO commerce instrumentpilot IF HE SAW ANYTHING.HE say HE SAW A _ ON runway _ move AT taxispeed OR LESS.THE pilotincommand THEN ask IF THE _ HAD us ani evade ACTON OR unusual HARD brake.HE respond NO AND THAT IT look AS IF HE WAS taxi AND WOULD GO BEHIND US TO TAKE THE taxiway THAT WE WERE vacate.HE say HE DIDN T THINK ANYTHING OF IT.IN FACT HE DIDN T MENTION IT UNTIL question BY THE pilotincommand SINCE HE THOUGHT EVERYTHING look NORMAL.THE pilotincommand THEN question HIM AS TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH aircraft AS WE cross THE intersect TO WHICH HE estimate _ feet.THE situate AS describe ABOVE obvious evolve FROM MY fail TO SEE THE OTHER aircraft.contribute factor THAT develop AFTER A CREW discuss WERE AS follow highworkload immediate AFTER start THE TAXI.multiplerunway IN us DUE TO MIX OF LIGHT singleengine.aircraft AND OUR JET WHICH require THE longerrunway TO MEET perform CRITERIA.IT IS NOT know IF ALL aircraft WERE utilize THE aeronauticaladvisorystationfrequency TO FULL ADVANTAGE SINCE NEITHER OF US remember hear THE _ ON FINAL FOR runway _.WE HAD cross _ TIME zone IN _ day.ALTHOUGH WE HAD PROPER REST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND I AWOKE feel WELL AND rest WERE WE AT OUR BEST.WAS OUR situationalawareness AT _ percent.THE PASSENGER ON THIS LEG WAS EARLY AND want TO GET go.DID THIS ADD TO distract AND CAUSE US TO RUSH.THE pilotincommand rely ON ME total TO CLEAR THE runway AND WAS headsdown WHEN THE intersect WAS cross.correctiveaction TO AVOID A LIKE situate IN THE FUTURE ARE AS follow STRICT COCKPIT POLICY AND procedure FOR UNCONTROLLED airport CLEAR announce BY THE pilotflying ON AN impend runwaycrossing WHICH WOULD ALERT BOTH pilot TO CLEAR THE runway.MAKE AN advise callout ON aeronauticaladvisorystation OF AN impend runwaycrossing.MAINTAIN aeronauticaladvisorystation WATCH ON number _ RADIO ONLY WITH THE number _ RADIO FOR clearance.DEL automaticweatherobservingreportingsystem fixedbaseoperator ETC.NEVER ALLOW THE INSIDE WORKLOAD TO OVERRIDE OUTSIDE vigil.BE AWARE OF affect THAT cross MULTIPLE TIME zone CAN HAVE ON on south bodyclock contribute TO A lessen situationalawareness.
1916~taxi FOR takeoff number _ generate trip OFF RESET AND trip OFF AGAIN.AFTER stop THE aircraft WE call maintain control AND DISPATCH AFTER explain THE SIT AND MYSELF go THROUGH THE minimumequipmentlist BOOK maintain control TOLD US WE COULD DELAY PLACARD install AND contact DISPATCH AND amend THE RELEASE AND continue ON TO sna airport.AFTER arrive IN sna airport maintain CAME TO THE aircraft AND WE WENT THROUGH THE minimumequipmentlist.I THEN realize WE HAD perform THE operate PORTION OF THE minimumequipmentlist BUT NOT THE maintain PORTION OF minimumequipmentlist.maintain control AND MYSELF DID NOT complete FOLLOW THE minimumequipmentlistprocedure.
1930~ON december _ fly AS pilotnotflying firstofficer ON aircraft airlinesflight XX _ aircraft XYZ IT AS LATER discover THAT THE minimumequipmentlist _ WAS AN IMPROPER minimumequipmentlist FOR THE ACTUAL problem WITH THE aircraft.THE captain AND I fly THE aircraft IN accord WITH SPECIAL procedure FOR minimumequipmentlist _ AS ALL inform AND PAPERWORK provide AT THE TIME OF THIS flight EVENT.

1933~EVENT runwayincursion OF runway AT cle airport ON december _.ON december _ I WAS operate AS pilotincommand IN A schedule COMMUTER OUT OF CLEVELAND OH.I AM A check AIRMAN FOR THIS COMMUTER operate AND TODAY WAS THE lastday OF _ daytrip AND _ day NOT CONSECUTIVE OF initialoperatingexperience.THE STUDENT I WAS WITH WAS A captain UPGRADE WITH _ hour AS rightseat pilot IN THIS SAAB _.THE STUDENT HAD BEEN do RATHER WELL UP TO THIS POINT WHEN DURING OUR taxichecklist THE aircraft cross THE HOLD SHORT LINE OF runway.THE STUDENT admit TO understand THE clearance AND MY READBACK OF THE SAME BUT IN perform A CERTAIN PART OF THE TAXI check BOTH captain south AND firstofficer south attention need TO BE divert FROM THE EXTERIOR OF THE AIRPLANE TO INTERIOR instrument momentary.AS I look UP TO check PROGRESS OF TAXI I notice THE FRONT OF THE aircraft HAD cross THE HOLD SHORT LINE.brake WERE apply immediate AND THE aircraft rest _ WAY ACROSS THE holdline.NO ACTION WAS take TO TAXI clear OF holdline AS aircraft WERE BEHIND US.AS THE check AIRMAN AND pilotincommand OF THE aircraft I FEEL AS THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE pay EXTRA CLOSE attention TO MY STUDENT south TAXI PROGRESS AS WE near THE HOLD SHORT LINE AND NOT TAKE FOR grant THE STUDENT south PRIOR ability AND demonstrate OF COMMAND.A secondfactor WOULD BE THE time OF THE PARTICULAR engine TEST FUNCTION THAT require BOTH OF OUR attentioninside THE COCKPIT.IN RETROSPECT I WOULD HAVE like TO BE stop TO PERFORM THIS FUNCTION OF OUR taxichecklist.THE THIRD AND FINAL FACTOR WOULD BE THE confuse WITH AN unfamiliarairport THAT I sense FROM MY STUDENT.ALTHOUGH WE HAD BEEN TO CLEVELAND _ OTHER occasion DURING OUR initialoperatingexperiencetraining THIS DAY WAS particular BUSY TO A SOMEWHAT confuse intersect OF runway AT cle airport.OUR clearance WAS TO TAXI FROM THE TERMINAL TO runway bywayof taxiway U AND runway _ HOLD SHORT runway.I READ THIS clearance TO THE STUDENT.HE READ IT BACK TO ME AND seem TO UNDERSTAND UNTIL HE HELD SHORT OF runway _.I explain THE clearance AGAIN AND THE COURSE TO BE take BUT HE STILL seem SOMEWHAT APPREHENSIVE AMIDST THE earlymorning RUSH OF traffic.FROM THERE WE taxi DOWN runway _ BUT miss THE holdline DRAWN ON runway _ WHILE perform OUR checklist.
1936~THIS WAS THE _ DAY FOR THIS NEW train ON posit AT THIS FACILITY.local control normal keep AN aircraft ON THEIR frequency UNTIL AFTER THEY CROSS THE INNER parallelrunway.THE _ WAS sidestep FROM runway OVER TO runway BY THE OTHER localcontroller BUT WAS NOT issue A frequency CHANGE TO OUR frequency.THE _ WAS hold IN posit ON runway.THE OTHER local coordinate WITH THE train TO crossrunway runway WITH THE _ AND WAS approve.WHILE I WAS coordinate WITH groundcontrol ON sever departure taxi OUT THAT HAD jump frequency AND WERE IN A STANDOFF _ aircraft ON _ taxiway wonder WHAT THEIR SEQUENCE WAS THE train clear THE _ FOR takeoff.THE OTHER local ask IF THE _ WAS roll AND I turn TO SEE THE _ stop IN THE MIDDLE OF THE runway.AS I start TO CANCEL THE _ south takeoffclearance HE rotate AND start A TURN.sever solution _ UNSURE aircraft ARE clear OF runway._ WHEN change aircraft TO ANOTHER runway ALSO ISSUE A frequency CHANGE TO THE APPROPRIATE control work THAT runway._ WHEN cross A runway DO NOT STOP UNTIL clear OF IT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE contact groundcontrol._ DURING A depart PUSH DO NOT CHANGE TO towerfrequency UNTIL number _ aircraft AT runway OR WHEN TOLD TO BY groundcontrol.local control IS BUSY ENOUGH WITHOUT have TO DO groundcontrol south sequence BECAUSE THE pilot change frequency BEFORE HE know WHO TO FOLLOW.
1937~AFTER A thoroughpreflight THE aircraft WAS IN THE load PHASE ON THE west IMPERIAL cargoramp.NORMAL aircraft shake AND load noise WERE note UNTIL THE load complete AT _.note WAS A CARGO _ IN THE load PHASE park CLOSE ON THE right SIDE OF OUR aircraft.NORMAL PUSHBACK AND flight TO DAYTON.ON postflight A HOLE WAS discover NEAR THE right WINGTIP leadingedge.UNDERNEATH THE WING BY THE HOLE WAS A LONG SCRAPE WITH YELLOW PAINT indicate IT WAS probable STRUCK BY A CARGO LOADER.RECOMMEND great aware BY groundpersonnel AND A safe PROGRAM THAT provide ground handler A WAY TO ADMIT TO mistake OR mishap WITH aircraft THUS prevent crew be UNAWARE OF DAMAGE.
1950~WHILE ON approach TO LAND IN BOSTON TO runway IN A BEECH _ OUR flap fail TO EXTEND.WE execute A goaraound AND notify airtrafficcontrol.ON THE DOWNWIND LEG WE perform THE flap FAIL TO EXTEND abnormalchecklist.airtrafficcontrol vector US TO LAND ON runway WITHOUT INCIDENT.ONCE clear THE runway I attempt TO CYCLE THE flap AND THEY work.I cycle THEM _ time BEFORE make A DECISION THEY WERE NOT broke.WE HAD THE AIRPLANE service AND load THE passenger FOR OUR CONTINUATION.THE problem IS UNKNOWN probable A MICROSWITCH.I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE call maintain AND minimumequipmentlist ED THE aircraft UNTIL IT COULD BE troubleshoot.LET THE mechanic DECIDE IF IT IS work proper.ALWAYS LEAN toward THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE OF decisionmaking IN THE flightdeck.
1955~aircraft aircraft XYZ A _ WAS AT GATE XA IN ZZZ AND WOULD CONTINUE ON TO yyy airport.WHILE do A TRANSIT check RED TAPE WAS FOUND ON THE EXTERIOR AIRSTAIR control accessdoor AND control HANDLE.THE aircraft maintain control OFFICE inform US THE airstair WERE inoperative DUE TO A broke CABLE TO THE control HANDLE AND defer PER THE _ minimumequipmentlist.THE maintain control OFFICE TOLD US TO CLOSE THE stair.THE control HANDLE WAS inoperative.I WENT INTO THE STAIRWELL AND activate THE STAIR control VALVE WITH THE broke CABLE TO CLOSE THE stair.THE stair raise UP AND engage THE UPLOCK MECHANISM.I visual check THE UPLOCK roller TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE proper engage WITH THE UPLOCK MECHANISM.THE MECHS OUTSIDE TOLD ME THE stair WERE fair WITH THE FUSELAGE.I exit THE aircraft THROUGH THE CABIN.WHEN aircraft land IN yyy airport THE airstair deploy AND WERE damage.WHEN I WAS inform THE nextday THAT THE stair deploy AFTER land I WAS shock.I DO NOT KNOW WHAT MADE THE stair UNLOCK.WE SHOULD HAVE take extratime TO MAKE SURE THE stair WERE defer proper PER THE _ minimumequipmentlist.THE minimumequipmentlist say THE stair MAY BE inoperative HYDRAULICALLY IT doe NOT refer broke control cable.
1957~AFTER deice AT PAD _ ON runway _ WHICH IS close WE receive A NONSTANDARD taxiclearance TO runway FOR depart.STANDARD WOULD BE runway FOR depart.I readback THE clearance AND THE captain begin TO TAXI THE aircraft.AS WE approach AN intersect THE captain seem UNSURE AS TO THE rout SO I ask IF HE want ground TO clear.HE DID SO ground GAVE US THE instruct.WE continue DOWN.AT THIS POINT THE taxichecklist AND pretakeoff CREW brief WAS complete.THE captain brief ME AND I HAD NO question AS THIS WAS hi LEG.WE continue TO taxiout AND FOUND THAT WE exceed OUR HOLDOVER TIME.THE captain advise ME TO UNBUCKLE AND check THE WING FOR THE pretakeoff contaminate check.I TOOK MY HEADSET OFF AND UNBUCKLED AS THE captain begin TO SLOW DOWN WHEN WE advise ME TO STOP.HE THEN MADE _ degree TURN AND taxi BACK ONTO THE taxiway.HE advise ME THAT HE HAD taxi ONTO AN activerunway.THE clearance HOLD SHORT OF runway AT taxiway west.WE DID NOT HOLD SHORT OF THIS intersect.factor INFLUENCING THIS ARE lowvisibility taxiwaysign obscure BY SNOW MY unfamiliar WITH HOPKINS CLEVELAND airport.I READ THE clearanceback AND assume MY captain know WHERE THAT WAS.I DID NOT KNOW WHERE WE WERE go BECAUSE IT WAS THE firsttime I HAD hear NONSTANDARD TAXI procedure EVEN THOUGH I HAD THE airportdiagram OUT.I WAS NO HELP FOR THE captain.
1958~activate THE runwayincursion DEVICE COULD HAVE prevent THE SIT.BETTER SCAN OF THE runway COULD HAVE prevent IT ALSO._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ tower special advise THE runwayincursion DEVICE IS activate deactivate AT THE local control posit.WHEN THE localcontroller transmit AN electron VOICE WILL transmit INTO THE towercabin check runway.THE special state THAT THE runwayincursion DEVICE HAS WIDESPREAD use WITHIN THE CENTRAL REGION ACE.
1959~UPON accomplish engineer CHANGE ORDER modify XBCA PART _ STEP _ ON december _ ON aircraft XYZ THE auxiliarytank WAS improper deactivate.I call maintain control BECAUSE OF differ ON MY engineer CHANGE ORDER.THEY DID NOT FIND ani inform TO ASSIST ME BUT WE agree THAT THE INTENT OF THE ENGINEER CHANGE ORDER WAS TO ASSURE THE auxiliarytank WOULD NOT ACCEPT FUEL.I call THE fueler OUT AND verify THAT NO FUEL WOULD ENTER THE auxiliarytank.ON december _ I research THE system AND FOUND THAT I HAD follow THE procedure maintain MANUAL pat auxiliarytank maintain _ _ STEP _ FOR THE wrongaircraft effect STEP _ WAS THE PROPER effect FOR aircraft XYZ.I immediate contact maintain control DXVO WXXZ AND HE follow THE channel TO HAVE THE aircraft bring INTO maintain TO ASSURE THE PROPER procedure WERE accomplish.THERE WAS AN effect ISSUE WITHIN AN effect ISSUE THAT I AND maintain control overlook.THE system WAS effect deactivate BUT NOT BY THE maintain MANUAL _.
1971~flight WAS THE _ SEGMENT OF _ daytrip THAT begin THE DAY BEFORE.IT WAS THE firstflight OF OUR SECOND dutyperiod AND WE HAD HAD A rest _ hour LAYOVER.OUR CREW HAD ampletime FOR preflight preparation.A placard inoperativefuel GAUGE WOULD REQUIRE supervise OF fuel.AS OUR preflight progress I BECAME concern THAT THE fuel WOULD CAUSE A DELAY AND begin coordinate WITH operate.THE flight ultimate WAS delay BY near _ hour raise problem FOR NUMEROUS connect ITINERARIES.A DELAY OF OVER _ minute WOULD jeopard OUR NEXT restperiod.DURING THE period distract of manage OUR DELAY OUR cockpitpreflight proceed normal AND include A REVIEW OF OUR departureclearance SPECIAL engineout procedure FOR runway _ AND REVIEW OF THE weigh MANIFEST include program OF THE flightmanagementcomputer.I brief THAT WE WOULD REQUEST runway _ OVER runway _ AND brief BOTH THE flightattendant AND firstofficer THAT OUR TAXI TIME WOULD BE QUICK.IN RETROSPECT THIS WAS A miss OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE AND BRIEF MORE thorough OUR taxiroute.I approach THE TAXI plan WITH confident THAT IT WAS A SIMPLE FAMILIAR rout.THE airportlayout WAS FAMILIAR ENOUGH THAT I DID NOT CONTEMPLATE THE possible FOR confuse.MY MENTAL PICTURE OF THE rout HAD _ _ right TURN A SHORT STRAIGHT AHEAD SEGMENT DURING WHICH THE TAXI check WOULD BE brisk accomplish.WE WOULD THEN transfer FROM ground TO tower FOR A runwayheading depart.IT WAS LATE DUSK.WE WERE clear AS expect TO runway _.THE progress OF THE TAXI check proceed AS expect.IN SHORT ORDER I WAS approach RED SIGNAGE indicate runway _.I BELIEVE I direct THE firstofficer TO SWITCH TO tower JUST AS HE WAS announce THE TAXI check COMPLETE.THE firstofficer THEN AT MY direct TOLD THE tower WE WERE READY.THE tower immediate clear US FOR takeoff ON runway _ runwayheading.I call FOR THE BEFORE takeoff check.THE firstofficer pick UP AND drop THE PA microphone.AFTER DISENTANGLING THE microphone HE complete THE BEFORE takeoff check AS I turn TO ALIGN WITH THE runway THAT HAD imbed thresholdlight orient ON A revers DIAGONAL TO MY taxiway.THIS WAS A bigmistake.I WAS operate ON A MENTAL PICTURE OF US turn FROM A basic east taxiway ONTO A revers DIAGONAL THAT WAS basic northwest.WRONG.THE revers DIAGONAL align ME WITH runway _.I simple HAD A DIAGONAL orient TO A CARDINAL runwaylayout ON MY BRAIN ALL IN keep WITH WHAT A please AND SIMPLE JOB I HAD.I HAD actual begin TO STAND THE THROTTLE AS I transfer control OF THE AIRPLANE TO THE firstofficer FOR hi takeoff A TELLTALE SIGN OF MY IMPATIENCE TO GET OUR TRIP BACK ON SCHEDULE.I REMEMBER take A GLANCE AT THE head select dial INTO THE automate flight MCP AND IT AGREEING WITH runway _.I ALSO note THE electronicflightmanagementsystem MAP DISPLAY.I perceive SOMETHING slight OUT OF WHACK BUT attribute TO IT THE rout LINE FROM THE airport TO THE FIRST FIX AND SMALL runway SYMBOLOGY DUE TO PERHAPS be IN THE _ mile SCALE INSTEAD OF THE USUAL _ mile SCALE.THE FIRST realize THAT WE HAD JUST take OFF ON THE wrongrunway occur AFTER head SELECT produce A MAJOR TURN.NONE OF THE local airtrafficcontrol control query OUR action.ZBW LATER forward A REQUEST THAT WE CONTACT BRADLEY airtrafficcontrol BY PHONE AFTER land.observe THIS IS THE MOST danger MISTAKE I VE COMMITTEE DURING MY AIRLINE CAREER.I cause THE problem BY allow complacent AND HURRY TO DOMINATE MY MINDSET.I diminish MY firstofficer south monitor capable BY overload AND hurry HIM.I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY WHETHER runway SIGNAGE WAS A significantfactor.I BELIEVE THE flightmanagementcomputer SOFTWARE SHOULD INCORPORATE A takeoffwarning WHEN TOGA IS push WHILE OUT OF align WITH select runway.
1982~I HAD JUST finish enginerunup PRIOR TO depart ON runway _.THERE WERE _ design RUNUP area mark WITH T south.I taxi OUT TO MAKE ROOM FOR OTHER aircraft AND pull OUT TOO FAR AND cross THE runway HOLD SHORT BAR.I FEEL THE HOLD SHORT BAR WAS TOO CLOSE TO design RUNUP SPOT.BY THE TIME I pull OUT I WAS ACROSS THE LINE.I COULD HAVE prevent IT BY pay MORE attention TO MY posit.
1985~december _ I WAS make A local flight WITH depart FROM MONTGOMERY airport _ CA ABOUT _.I HAVE A NEW PORTABLE INTERCOM IN MY _ AND IT WAS ingest NOISE INTO THE RADIO system SO THAT I WAS have difficult communicate WITH THE tower.I SHOULD HAVE return TO BASE.BUT INSTEAD I THOUGHT I HAD clearance FOR takeoff WHEN IN FACT I DID NOT.AS A RESULT I cause THE tower TO ORDER A goaraound FOR ANOTHER aircraft.
1986~FOUND ON arrive WAS A CREASE TYPE DENT IN THE FUSELAGE SKIN approximate _ feet AFT OF DOOR runway.THE DENT WAS near vertical AND RAN ACROSS A STRINGER.THE SKIN DENT WAS FOUND TO BE WITHIN THE limit OF maintain MANUAL _ PARAGRAPH _ _.I WAS call TO INVESTIGATE DAMAGE FOUND ON arrive AND ASSIST IN GENERAL AS THE supervise.I check THE DAMAGE visual AND call FOR AN inspect WITH EDDY CURRENT equip TO DETERMINE IF ani crack exist IN THE SKIN.inspect us NON destruct test.confirm NO crack AND I check THE support STRUCTURE.I FOUND THAT THE STRINGER HAD BEEN displace slight AS WOULD BE expect FROM THE dent SKIN BUT I SAW NO DAMAGE.WITH NO STRINGER DAMAGE THE CONDITION WAS determine BY ME TO BE WITHIN specify OF maintain MANUAL _ PARAGRAPH _ _ AND I defer REPAIR.I THEN MADE arrangement FOR THE REPAIR TO BE MADE AT flight terminate OF THAT DAY IN ZZZ.DURING THAT REPAIR THE AREA WAS disassemble FOR inspect AND THE STRINGER WAS FOUND TO BE dent.THE DAMAGE WAS IN AN unpressurize AREA AND THE STRINGER DAMAGE WAS NOT A CREASE BUT A SLIGHT DENT IN THE SKIN attach FLANGE.THE inspect AND SUBSEQUENT repair WERE THEN complete.
2001~THIS happen AT XXX airport ON december _ approximate _.I HAD _ TRANSIT check TO DO on ON A _ AND THE OTHER on ON A _ aircraft respect WHICH arrive approximate _ minute APART.DURING THE WALKAROUND I FOUND number _ BRAKE ON THE _ WORN OUT BELOW limit.AS SOON AS I finish THE WALKAROUND I approach THE LEAD FOR latenight SHIFT WHO WAS ALREADY ON THE premise FOR HELP.THE latenight south LEAD SENT _ MECHS AND _ JUNIOR MECHS TO REPLACE THAT number _ BRAKE.SINCE I WAS BUSY WITH THE _ TRANSIT check I COULD NOT HELP.I wit THE BRAKE install ON THE AXLE BUT NOT THE WHEEL install.IN XXX WHERE THEY FOUND number _ TIRE FLAT BEFORE depart report THAT THE BRAKE key WERE NOT align TO THE BRAKE rotor.BOTH BRAKE AND TIRE WERE replace AFTER THE flight.
2008~IT WAS discover DURING A ROUTINE inspect THAT THE aircraftlogbook contain A PREVIOUS ENTRY SPECIFYING THAT THE visualinspection requirement OF airworthinessdirective _ HAD BEEN comply WITH AT THAT TIME BUT THE NON destruct test inspect ALSO call OUT WERE NOT.THESE NON destruct test inspect WERE list AS NOT DUE FOR ANOTHER _ land._ land IS THE recur inspect PERIOD aircraft track PROGRAM maintain IS COMPUTER assist maintain PROGRAM system.THE VISUAL inspect ARE list UNDER THEIR OWN track code BUT THE NON destruct test IS NOT.THE WORK CARD HAD A concur SIGNOFF FOR THE visualinspection associate servicebulletin AND THE airworthinessdirective.IT WAS intend TO signoff THE visualinspection ONLY.DURING dataentry THE code FOR ALL _ task WERE update.SINCE THE airworthy WAS enter AS complete track THROUGH COMPUTER assist maintain PROGRAM PRIMARY maintain track SOURCE begin.NO on LIST OR project maintain sheet show THE airworthinessdirective AS be partial comply WITH.UPON discover OF A POSSIBLE OVERFLY immediateaction WAS TO COMPLETE NON destruct test inspect PRIOR TO FURTHER flight.AN intern investigate THROUGH fixedbaseoperator inspect AND COMPUTER assist maintain PROGRAM comply form EXIST.
2009~MIDLAND ground issue taxiinstruction TO runway.WE approach intersect P THAT lead TO runwaythreshold THERE WAS SOME confuse BY THE CREW AS TO WHERE THE END OF THE runway WAS locate AS taxiway left IS VERY CLOSE AND THAT lead TO runway _ WHICH WAS NOT THE activerunway AT THE TIME.OUR aircraft taxi PAST runway AND ONTO taxiway left THAT lead TO runway _.groundcontrol question US AND WE WERE give permit TO TAXI ONTO runway _ AND THEN PROCEED north AT THE intersect OF runway TO THE THRESHOLD.ALL THESE event occur IN A MATTER OF _ second FROM THE TIME OUR CREW question OUR posit UNTIL WE HAD taxi ONTO runway _ bywayof taxiway left.NO CONFLICT WITH OTHER aircraft OR groundvehicle occur.contribute factor clear visualflightrulesday lastleg OF SEQUENCE fail TO STOP THE aircraft south TAXI AND QUESTION airtrafficcontrol THE MOMENT THERE WAS ani DOUBT AS TO THE CORRECT locate OF runwaythreshold.
2015~depart basicgroundinstructor NOT IN comply WITH minimumequipmentlist _.ask mechanic IF HE HAD check hydraulicsystem PER minimumequipmentlist AND HE say THAT HE HAD.I SAW A signoff FOR comply AND was distract BY A problem IN THE CABIN WITH THE number _ flightattendant.WE TOOK _ minute DELAY.enroute WHEN write ANOTHER ITEM I SAW THAT THE signoff OF THE hydraulicsystem QUANTITY WAS FROM mia airport THE previousday NOT FROM basicgroundinstructor THAT morn.
2018~approximate _ second AFTER takeoffclearance receive aircraft accelerate tower cancel takeoffclearance.I advise UNABLE AND tower respond BY send commuteraircraft AROUND I WAS depart runway HE WAS land runway OR runway.I NEVER SAW CONFLICT aircraft.tower hand ME OFF TO depart WITH thank FOR YOUR HELP AND control adjust TO MY COMMAND BY send COMMUTER AROUND ALL handle safe.reject takeoff FOR ME A VERY BIG DEAL AS automaticbrake ARM ABOVE _ knot VIOLENT brake.ALSO passenger ANXIETY AND POSSIBLE PANIC brakecooling AND QRH checklist TO PERFORM.
2020~right of way AND blindspot IN COCKPIT.arrive AT mia airport AND land ON runway AFTER AN airtransportradio SMALL VERSION cross activerunway _ AT taxiway Y AND I WAS TOLD TO CROSS AT taxiway V AND TO contactground.AS I WAS cross I realize THERE WAS NO airtransportradio IN SIGHT.I WAS _ WAY ACROSS runway _.I THEN stab ON brake momentary AND THE NOSE OF THE airtransportradio merge FROM BEHIND THE left FORWARD cockpitwindow SUPPORT AS THE airtransportradio WAS taxi left TO right ON paralleltaxiway TOWARD THE intersect OF taxiway V.THEN I FURTHER notice HE WAS NOT yield TO traffic ON hi right NOR TO traffic have TO clear AN activerunway WHICH ARE suppose TO HAVE right of way.I FURTHER brake AND yield TO THE airtransportradio.ground WAS clobber SO WE HAD TO STOP AFTER clear runway _ BEFORE WE COULD taxion THE ramparea.I DID NOT MAKE ani comment ON THE groundfrequency HOWEVER WE NEED TO DISCUSS THESE type OF SITS involve smallaircraft VERSUS MUCH largeraircraft AND THE VISION limit OF THE COCKPIT AND right of way rule.IF I HAD BEEN A _ WE MIGHT HAVE HAD A collide.THE copilot assume YOU CAN SEE THE aircraft BECAUSE THERE IS NO obstruct TO VISION FROM hi SIDE AND HE start TO CHANGE TO groundfrequency.I SUGGEST AN OPEN discuss AMONG CHIEF pilot AND ground control.WE ARE go TO HAVE A LOT OF construct INCIDENT SITS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF SERIOUS DAMAGE.
2021~AFTER have OUR aircraft work ON FOR _ mechanicalproblem I WENT OVER THE mechanic south WORK.on ITEM WAS A leak ESCAPE HATCH.THE HATCH WORK appear TO BE COMPLETE AND THE SIGNOFF WAS IN ORDER.THE OTHER ITEM WAS A defer OF THE MAIN BATTERY CHARGER.THIS defer HAS _ operate option pertain BECAUSE OF THE complex OF THE procedure TO OPERATE WITH THE auxiliarypowerunit operate TO THE auxiliarypowerunit.THE auxiliarypowerunit CAN BE secure operate OR inoperative.aircraft maintain control instruct THE CONTRACT mechanic TO SECURE THE auxiliarypowerunit inoperative.THIS procedure IS WITHOUT NEED OF ani tool OR TEST equip AND IS accomplish IN THE COCKPIT.THIS procedure involve make SURE BY cockpitindication THAT THE auxiliarypowerunit IS OFF AND THE auxiliarypowerunit DOOR IS close.THE mechanic THEN open AND collar circuitbreaker _ AND _ ON circuitbreakerpanel number _.UPON inspect I FOUND THAT UNDER aircraft maintain control south direct OUR CONTRACT mechanic HAD open AND collar circuitbreaker _ ON circuitbreakerpanel number _ auxiliarypowerunit BATTERY CHARGER INSTEAD OF _ ON circuitbreakerpanel number _ MAIN BATTERY CHARGER.I BELIEVE THIS ERROR WAS A consequent OF sever factor _ THE CONTRACT mechanic south INEXPERIENCE WITH THE _._ aircraft maintain control south INEXPERIENCE A RESULT OF HIGH TURNOVER._ THE understand OF aircraft maintain control depart.
2024~UPON land IN ZZZ WE receive INBOARD AND OUTBOARD groundspoiler FAULT STATUS message.THEY DID NOT DISPLAY.CONTRACT maintain WAS contact AND UNDER THE direct OF companymaintenance RESET THE RELEVANT circuitbreaker AND THEN actuate THE groundspoiler UNTIL THEY operate proper _ time.THE ONBOARD maintain DATA COMPUTER record NO FAULT HAD occur.NOT satisfy WITH THIS SOLUTION I talk TO OUR maintenancedepartment WHO THEN direct THE CONTRACT mechanic TO check THE SPOILER electroniccontrolunit COMPUTER IN THE avionic BAY.IT TOO fail TO RECORD ani fault.I THEN contact OUR PROGRAM manage FOR THE _.HE suggest conduct THE firstflight OF THE DAY procedure FOR THE hydraulic AND ground LIFT dump system AND THEN conduct A lowspeed ABORT.THE pilot south MANUAL define HIGH speed ABORT AS ANYTHING OVER _ knotsindicatedairspeed SO THE firstofficer AND I agree ON _ knotsindicatedairspeed.AFTER conduct THE check AND THE ABORT I call maintain TO INFORM THEM OF THE result IN regard TO ground LIFT dump deploy.maintain THEN inform ME THAT AN ABORT AT _ knotsindicatedairspeed WOULD REQUIRE A BRAKE inspect THAT COULD ground THE aircraft FOR AN ENTIRE DAY.I HAVE _ point TO MAKE.THE PRESSURE TO ACCEPT A FIX WHICH ONLY entail reset A system UNTIL YOU GET THE RESULT YOU WANT WITHOUT ani KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT cause THE problem IS UNACCEPTABLE special give THAT NO RELIEF FOR BOTH INBOARD AND OUTBOARD groundspoiler inoperative IS give IN OUR minimumequipmentlist.WE DO NOT HAVE performancedata FOR THIS SCENARIO.SECOND THE OBVIOUS DISCREPANCY between maintain south define OF A HIGH speed ABORT AND THE pilot south MANUAL define IS WITHOUT EXCUSE.IT CAME TO MY attention DURING SUBSEQUENT converse WITH companyofficial THAT THIS DISCREPANCY HAS BEEN know FOR AT LEAST _ month.IN FACT THEY HAVE BEEN try TO GET THIS RELIEF FROM THE _ knotsindicatedairspeed define._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THE flight AND groundspoiler WERE NOT AN minimumequipmentlist allow defer ITEM AND THE maintain control WAS push HARD TO MOVE THE AIRPLANE.THE report say spoilerdeployment problem ARE A continue problem ON THE region jet.THE report state THE repeat test OF A system UNTIL itself test OK IS UNSATISFACTORY.THE report say THE system WAS test _ time AND test OK ON THE _ ATTEMPT.THE report say THE maintain record AND THE SPOILER electroniccontrolunit DID NOT RECORD ani FAULT WHEN check BY THE CONTRACT TECHNICIAN.THE report state AN operate PROGRAM manage suggest A ground TEST AND A lowspeed ABORT AT _ knot TO TEST THE spoiler WHICH result IN A require BRAKE check PER THE maintain MANUAL THAT ground THE AIRPLANE.THE report state THE WHOLE SIT WAS complete MISMANAGED.
2026~DURING takeoff ROLL AT approximate _ knot A LOUD THUMP WAS hear.takeoff WAS continue BUT ONCE AIRBORNE THE aircraft WOULD NOT PRESSURIZE.consult WITH DISPATCH AND maintain control concern OUR pressurizationproblem.divers TO ewr airport WAS perform AFTER discuss WITH DISPATCH.UPON arrive AT ewr airport A HOLE ABOUT _ inch IN DIAMETER WAS FOUND ON THE low FUSELAGE ABOUT _ feet AFT OF THE nosegear.jfk airportauthority report find A recess LIGHT COVER lay ON runway AFTER be notify WE HAD STRUCK SOMETHING ON takeoff ROLL.IT IS suspect OUR nosegear kick THE LIGHT coverup TO OUR FUSELAGE DURING OUR takeoff ROLL.
2032~EVENT runwayincursion.WE taxi approximate _ feet ONTO KPVD runway AT taxiway D JUST AS AN aircraft Y AIRBUS WAS clear FOR TAKEOFF.THE captain stop OUR slowtaxi AT THE sametime THE aircraft Y pilot announce hi ABORT _.THE AIRBUS slow TO A VERY SLOW taxispeed AND pass IN FRONT OF US BY ABOUT _ feet HE pull TO THE right OF THE runwaycenterline AND continue TO THE END OF THE runway.WE turn right AFTER stop FOR _ minute ONTO runway taxi ONTO _ AN south THEN follow A FOLLOW ME TRUCK BACK TO THE RAMP GATE TO offload SOME weigh.CHAIN OF event CONTRIBUTION factor automaticterminalinformationservice _ _ _ LT SNOW _ SCT _ OVC _ _.actualweather WAS deteriorate rapid AND MAY HAVE BEEN _ _ SM visible WITH blow heavysnow.runwayvisualrange report _ AT _.WE push AT _ begin deice AT _.onboard COMPUTER computation FOR A WET GOOD runway THE CONDITION AT PUSH WERE complete AND THE onboard COMPUTER WAS place ON THE CONSOLE PRIOR TO OUR _ TAXI FROM THE deice PAD.runwayvisualrange WAS THEN report _ SO THE captain coordinate FOR A TAKEOFF altern.taxiinstruction WERE taxiway T C runway.THE WEATHER WAS get WORSE.THE captain TOLD ME WE D NEED TO INSPECT THE wing BEFORE TAKEOFF SINCE WE D BEEN deice WITH TYPE _ FLUID.I inform THE tower OF THIS AS WE approach THE END OF runway AND WERE turn ONTO taxiway D.THE captain AND I discuss THE accumulate SNOW _ AND I begin look AT THE onboard COMPUTER WITH A THIN clutter runway AND discover WE WERE TOO HEAVY.I inform THE captain AND WE WERE discuss THIS WHEN THE runwayincursion occur.HOW TO PREVENT A reoccur WITH THE weathercondition WE HAD I SHOULD HAVE BEEN look OUTSIDE DURING THE TAXI.THE captain WAS taxi extreme SLOW AND I mistake assume HE STILL HAD SIGHT OF AND WAS follow THE AIRBUS TO runway.complacent WAS NOT A FACTOR AS THE captain insure WE WERE method IN accomplish COCKPIT task.WE HAD take _ _ HOUR DELAY early IN leave ISLIP DUE TO EXTREME snowcondition VERY SLOW deice procedure AND problem WITH HOLDOVER time AND coordinate THIS WITH AN OPEN runway.THE deice TIME HAD TO BE time perfect WITH A fresh plow runway.PERHAPS THE urgent TO AVOID ANOTHER DELAY lead ME TO NOT priority MY task correct.I HAD THE AIRFIELD DIAGRAM ON MY CLIPBOARD AND HAD discuss THE TAXI rout WITH THE captain BUT LEFT IT OUT OF MY CROSSCHECK ONCE WE WERE follow THE AIRBUS AND turn left ON taxiway D.IN THE FUTURE I WILL NOT GO headsdown WHEN taxi IN adverseweather.THE captain ask ME TO DO THIS FOR A MEMORY PROMPT TO RESET THE flap TRIM WHICH WERE OUT OF takeoffposition DUE TO taxi through SLUSH._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ DURING CALLBACK THE report say THAT THEIR clearance FOR TAXI WAS TO FOLLOW THE AIRBUS TO THE runway.HE LET THE distract OF hi OTHER duty LEAVE THE taxi TO THE captain WITH NO BACKUP AND DID NOT REALIZE THAT aircraft Y HAD got SO FAR AHEAD OR THAT THE captain MAY HAVE lostsight OF IT IN THE lowvisibilityconditions.CALLBACK comment FROM THE captain HE lostsight OF THE AIRBUS BUT HAD BEEN issue THE taxiroute SO HE continue miss A _ DEGREE turnon THE taxiroute DID NOT SEE THE HOLD SHORT LINE WHICH WAS SNOW cover DID NOT SEE ani direct sign OR THE install wigwag light.HE assume WITH snowremoval operate AND blowingsnow condition AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE obscure.SNOW WAS UP TO _ feet DEEP ALONG THE taxiway.WHEN sight THE AIRBUS ON THE runway HE DID NOT REALIZE UNTIL THE REJECT WAS ANNOUNCE THAT HE WAS see THE FRONT OF THE AIRCRAFT AND NOT THE BACK SO HE COULD CONTINUE follow.
2038~WHILE wait BEHIND COMPANY _ AT intersect right stl airport airport WE hear THEM clear ACROSS runway.NEXT WE hear _ clear ACROSS runway.MY firstofficer announce aircraft xabc clear ACROSS runway.WE visual clear left AND right FOR traffic AND start ACROSS THE HOLD SHORT LINE.THE control state aircraft X EXPEDITE ACROSS runway previousclearance WAS FOR aircraft Y.I inquire ABOUT US definite be clear ACROSS runway AND IF THERE WERE conflict callsign.THE control state THAT cross clearance WAS FOR aircraft Y XABC BUT HE HAD coordinate OUR cross WITH THE tower WHEN HE SAW US move.possible THE aircraft Y X OF aircraft Y XABC WAS block BY OUR COMPANY traffic cross BEFORE US.AFTER THEIR cross instruct WE hear JUST ABC clear ACROSS runway.WE assume IT WAS mean FOR US aircraft xabc AS WE WERE NEXT AT intersect right.WE DID visual clear THE runway FOR potentialtraffic AND THERE WAS NOT ani CONFLICT.
2044~HOW problem arise I FLY PIPER NAVAJOS.on aircraft WAS report BY ANOTHER pilot TO HAVE AN ERRATIC attitudeindicator.SINCE THIS pilot ALSO say THE aircraft south HEATER WASN T operate WELL THE conclude WAS THAT THE attitudeindicator problem WAS COLD relate.WE decide TO extensive PREHEAT THE CABIN SEE IF THE attitudeindicator function AND TAKE THE PLANE TO fai airport.ON inspect THE CABIN AFTER THIS OTHER pilot south problem I note THE HEATER temperature control WAS turn DOWN.I check weather FOR THE flight TO fai airport WHICH show visualflightrules FOR depart FROM BARROW instrumentflightrulescondition OVER THE brook rang enroute AND visualflightrules IN fai airport.PIREPS WERE NOT avail BUT THE BRIEFER say TO EXPECT TO BE between layer enroute.I file AN instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN ALONG _ FROM BARROW BRW TO bettle BTT TO FAIRBANKS fai airport.MEANWHILE A ground heat UNIT WAS apply TO THE aircraft.AFTER START I note THE attitudeindicator function perfect AND THE HEATER put OUT lot OF HEAT.I activate MY instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN AND depart BRW AT _.ABOUT _ minute INTO THE flight I contact fai airport operate bywayof RADIO TELEPHONE RELAY AND inform MY manage THAT THE PLANE WAS function perfect attitudeindicator AND HEATER.I WAS TOLD TO RETURN TO BARROW.I cancel MY instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN AND DID _ degree TURN._ minute LATER operate call AND TOLD ME TO CONTINUE TO fai airport.SINCE I D BEEN TOLD THAT ZAN isn airport T VERY TOLERANT OF instrumentflightrules pop up clearance request IN THE ARCTIC COAST AREA AND SINCE I COULD SEE visualmeteorologicalconditions ABOVE THE cloud FAR IN FRONT OF ME toward fai airport FROM _ feetmeansealevel I elect TO REMAIN visualflightrules AND FOLLOW MY GPS DIRECT TO fai airport AND PICK UP AN instrumentflightrules descend.AS I approach THE brook rang THE cloudtop GOT high.I climb TO _ feetmeansealevel plan TO contactflightservicestation AND REFILE ALONG _ WHICH WAS NOW TO MY right.ARAKTRUK PASS report _ mile visible AND bettle WAS visualflightrules SO I head DIRECT TOWARD bettle AND start try TO contactflightservicestation.AT ABOUT THIS TIME MY CREW HATCH locate direct TO MY left blow OPEN.SINCE I WAS singlepilot I SET THE autopilot AND start work TO CLOSE THE DOOR.I feel IT critic TO SECURE THIS DOOR WITH outsideairtemperature approximate _ degree BELOW ZERO I WAS worry ABOUT lose THE attitudeindicator WITH NIGHT approach.AFTER sever minute OF struggle I GOT THE DOOR close.IT WAS THEN THAT I notice THE aircraft south altitude HAD change AND show A descend THROUGH _ feet.I immediate apply climb power AND crosscheck MY posit WHICH show ME south OF THE high peak AND level OFF AT _ feet WHICH IS SAFE IN THAT AREA.I start feel STRANGE.subsequent I discover THAT I WAS AT _ feet AND HAD apparent MISREAD MY ALTIMETER.WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS descend THROUGH _ feet I WAS actual AT _ feet.I AM convince HYPOXIA AND THE COLD couple WITH MY relate INEXPERIENCE operate singlepilot MADE deal WITH THE CREW HATCH problem EVEN WORSE.fortunate I WAS ABLE TO immediate descend GET THE autopilot setup AND getback ON AN instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN.THE REST OF THE flight WAS UNEVENTFUL.contribute factor WHILE discuss THE CREW HATCH problem WITH maintain I WAS TOLD THE problem WAS long stand.I HAVE HAD THE DOOR POP AFTER takeoff BEFORE AND WAS ALWAYS ABLE TO CLOSE IT quick WITH copilot south HELP.I HAVE NEVER HAD on OPEN IN CRUISE BEFORE.THE confuse WITH operate regard return TO BARROW WAS A FACTOR cause ME TO CANCEL instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN WHICH WOULD HAVE keep ME AT _ feet THE WHOLE WAY.MY DISINCLINATION TO CONTACT ZAN TO reestablish AN instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN WAS base ON RUMOR.I WILL CALL AND FILE AS THE SIT dictate FROM NOW ON.last AFTER A RASH OF coldweather relate problem IN BARROW I WAS ANXIOUS TO fulfil THE COMPANY south expect.PHONE discuss WITH THE COMPANY south GENERAL manage AND PRESIDENT THAT DAY MADE IT clear THE PLANE HAD TO GET TO fai airport.ALTHOUGH THE flight mark THE begin OF AN _ DAY VACATION I honest DON T THINK person GET there WAS A FACTOR AS evidence BY MY DESIRE TO TAKE A function PLANE _ degree BACK TO BARROW.I THINK profession GET.
2045~WE WERE taxi TO runway.WE HELD SHORT OF intersect D FOR A MOONEY THEN BEHIND THE MOONEY WHO cross intersect A WHILE HE HELD SHORT FOR AN _.AS HE cross intersect A WE WERE clear TO TAXI TO runway.WE pass BEHIND THE _ AND continue TO FOLLOW THE MOONEY TO runway.AS WE cross THE HOLD SHORT LINE FOR THE STOPWAY FOR runway WE SAW AN _ ON A HIGH left BASE THE copilot say WE HAVE AN _ ON BASE WHO JUST WENT knife edge TO FINAL _ degree left TURN.WE stop THE AIRPLANE ACROSS THE holdline BUT SHORT OF THE STOPWAY edgeline.NO PART OF OUR aircraft WAS ON THE STOPWAY.AS OUR aircraft finish stop ground call US TO STOP WHICH WE ALREADY WERE.THE _ WENT AROUND.WE WERE TOLD TO TURN left ON runway _ THEN left ON _ TO clear THEN GO TO tower.WE WERE LATER notify BY tower THAT THEY WERE file A pilotdeviation report.WE actual HAD THE _ IN SIGHT THE wholetime AND initiate THE stop.contribute factor _ militaryaircraft AT A mix us airport fly NONSTANDARD pattern._ HAWKER INTERCOM HAS NO VOLUME control SO SOMETIMES IT IS HARD TO HEAR copilot AND airtrafficcontrol WHEN local control ARE talk SOMETIMES._ militaryaircraft ARE transmit ON ultrahighfrequency.SOME situationalawareness WAS LOST WITH RESPECT TO keep TRACK OF WHICH _ WAS WHICH._ try TO completechecklist item navigate ACROSS THE airport MONITOR ALL call AT AN unfamiliarairport._ AS A CREW ON SUBSEQUENT leg WE decide TO COMPLETE ALL checklistitem THAT DON T REQUIRE aircraftmovement IN THE block leave US BOTH TO FOCUS ON SURFACE move.
2046~AFTER land AND exit runway WE WERE TOLD BY THE towercontroller TO crossrunway runway TAXI bywayof taxiway north AND taxiway P HOLD SHORT runway contactground.THE clearance WAS readback AND WE switch TO groundcontrol.ground instruct US TO TAXI bywayof taxiway north taxiway P crossrunway runway.THE firstofficer readback THE clearance.I repeat THE clearance TO THE firstofficer AND WE continue OUR TAXI.AS WE cross runway THE groundcontrol advise US THAT WE WERE TOLD TO HOLD SHORT OF runway.THERE WAS NO traffic ON THE runway OR approach.THE firstofficer TOLD THE control THAT HE THE firstofficer HAD readback A clearance TO crossrunway runway.ground THEN say THAT IT WAS OK THERE south NO problem.WE continue OUR TAXI TO THE GATE.I THINK THAT SOME OF THE contribute factor WERE _ THE LACK OF A READBACK OF THE HOLD SHORT instruct BY THE firstofficer.HE INSTEAD readback THE clearance THAT WE BOTH hear._ THE groundcontrol NOT request THE require runway HOLD SHORT READBACK._ THE FACT THAT NO MENTION OF runway WAS EVER MADE BY groundcontrol EVEN THOUGH IT MUST BE cross IN ORDER TO REACH runway._ THE groundcontrol WAS BUSY WITH numerousaircraft THAT WERE wait ON taxiway FOR THEIR gate.THE gate AND ramp WERE congest WITH aircraft be deice.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ I KNOW I hear TAXI T OTHER GATE AND IT IS WHAT I readback.IF IT WASN T WHAT THE groundcontrol say HE SHOULD HAVE correct ME.

2550~WE WERE IN LINE FOR takeoff FROM phx airport TO cmh airport.THE aircraft BEHIND US report THAT WE HAD FUEL pour OUT THE VENT ON OUR right WING.WE notify groundcontrol OF THE problem AND contact COMPANY.WE ALSO ask THAT THE fireequipment standby AS A PRECAUTION.WHEN WE WERE notify OF THE problem WE immediate shutdown THE right engine AND fuelpump IN THE right WING.maintain CAME OUT TO THE aircraft AND DID AN exteriorinspection OF THE aircraft AND report NO MORE FUEL depart THE aircraft.WE receive clearance FROM ground AND return TO THE GATE.THERE WAS AN minimumequipmentlist ON THE aircraft THAT require THAT THE center tankfuel pump BE turn OFF DURING cockpitsetup AND turn ON AFTER SLAT retract AIRBORNE.WE HAD fail TO DO THIS FOR reason note NEXT ALTHOUGH THE minimumequipmentlist WAS brief ON THE firstleg OF THE DAY THE TRIP consist OF _ leg THAT DAY.THE FIRST _ leg DID NOT REQUIRE FUEL IN THE center TANK AND wingtank WERE NOT FULL SO center tankpump WERE NOT turn ON.BY THE THIRD LEG THE minimumequipmentlist WAS NOT AT THE FOREFRONT OF THOUGHT.THE maintenancepersonnel WERE suppose TO HAVE install A STICKER ON THE center PUMP control SWITCH.THIS STICKER WAS miss.THE outsideairtemperature WAS _ degree AND THE aircraft WAS park AT THE GATE face west PRIOR TO depart.WITH THE BEST effort OF BOTH ground AND ONBOARD aircondition THE flightdeck temperature WAS indicate _ degree F.affect pilot perform THE pilot WERE ALSO IN THE CIRCADIAN LOW AND HAD NOT eat SINCE BREAKFAST.PLUS THERE WERE MULTIPLE MELS ON THE aircraft.keep THEM STRAIGHT WAS ALSO CAUSAL.conclude A LOT OF mistake WERE MADE BY sever party.fortunate THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT.LESSON learn MY POLICY WILL NOW BE TO BRIEF EACH minimumequipmentlist PRIOR TO EACH LEG THUS keep THE aircraft CONDITION FOREFRONT PRIOR TO depart.

2661~I FLY A LITTLE CITATION isp airport base HERE AT PLYMOUTH IN airport A CITY own AND operate FACILITY _.recent A runway CHANGE IN mark AND extend OF THE displace THRESHOLD HAS develop A VERY LARGE safetyhazard.WHILE study THE NEW runwaylayout AND compare IT TO THE commerce approach CHART I FOUND THE CHART TO BE incorrect show A STOPWAY AS PART OF THE use runway WITH A TURNAROUND ON THE east END.THE STOPWAY HAS BEEN fresh paint WITH chevron indicate A NON TAXI AREA.THE CITY WITHOUT federalaviationadministration approve install THE TURNAROUND AREA ON A chevron NON TAXI AREA.I HAVE report THE CHART ERROR TO THE CHART PEOPLE.I ALSO report THE ERROR TO THE CITY BOARD OF AVIATION commission.THE BOAC respond WAS THAT ALL THE BIG jet ARE us TURNAROUND SO IT MUST BE OK.I call THE localflightstandardsdistrictoffice WITH THE BOAC respond AND WAS TOLD THAT taxi ON THE chevron AREA WILL BRING A violate._ problem EXIST HERE.THE OUT OF TOWN hawker GIV CHALLENGER _ ETC TAXI RIGHT ONTO THE STOPWAY BECAUSE THERE IS A TURNAROUND ON THAT AREA AND IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PIVOT AROUND ON A _ feet WIDE runway TO DEPART AT THE THRESHOLD.WE HAVE NO taxiway AT _.EVERYTHING require taxi ON THE runway FOR departure.I question THE HAWKER _ captain AS TO hi taxi ONTO A chevron STOPWAY AND HE say HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE CHEVRON area be UNAVAILABLE FOR taxi.THE SECOND problem IS AN AIRPLANE main A LARGE AIRPLANE sit ON THE STOPWAY IS violate THE land aircraft south OBJECT freezone.THE land aircraft south safetymargin IS reduce SHOULD HE UNDERSHOOT THE land THRESHOLD.THIS aircraft ALSO IS direct IN THE federalaviationadministration south runway protect ZONE.THIS IS particular UNSAFE HERE AT _ BECAUSE WE HAVE A SHORT runway WITH HIGH TREE obstruct THAT PARALLEL THE runway.WE HAVE HIGH crosswindcondition THAT CAUSE turbulent OVER THE tree THAT PRODUCE WINDSHEARS OF _ plus knot regular.A SHORT approach WITH UNEXPECTED WINDSHEAR COULD PUT THE land aircraft IN CONTACT WITH AN AIRPLANE sit IN THE OBJECT FREE AREA.I HAVE NOW BEEN inform THAT THE CITY IS JUST go TO TAKE THE chevron OFF THE STOPWAY AND PAINT YELLOW taxiway line ON THE STOPWAY.NOW EVEN THE pilot THAT KNOW WHAT chevron MEAN WILL BE sit IN THE OBJECT FREE AREA AND runway protect ZONE.THE correctiveaction IN MY OPINION IS TO INSTALL A NEW TURNAROUND AT THE END OF THE use runway AND ELIMINATE THE TURNAROUND ON THE STOPWAY.enclose ARE SOME draw THAT MAY BE OF SOME HELP IN understand THE SIT.

3377~captain believe HE WAS clear INTO posit AND HOLD.UPON TAXI INTO posit tower call THAT WAS FOR aircraft Y NOT aircraft X.captain OF MY PLANE HAD confirm clearance PRIOR TO cross THE HOLD SHORT.
3380~DURING TAXI FOR depart I inadvertent taxi ACROSS THE runway BOUNDARY SIGN AT AN intersect.I realize THIS occur WHEN I notice THE airport locate SIGN show THAT I WAS close TO THE runway THAN I believe HENCE I MUST HAVE cross THE BOUNDARY SIGN.THIS WAS confirm WHEN I look IN THE oppositedirection AND COULD bare DISCERN THE BOUNDARY SIGN approximate _ feet AWAY.AT THIS POINT I begin TO taxiback TO THE paralleltaxiway.THIS IS ALSO WHEN THE groundcontrol begin TO ISSUE progressivetaxiinstructions TO ME.eventual I FOUND THE runuparea complete THE pretakeoff check AND depart uneventful.WITHOUT realize AT THE TIME THIS INCIDENT WAS THE CULMINATION OF be preoccupy BY THE weather SHIFT NEW TAXI PLAN COMFORT OF MY passenger AND GENERAL unfamiliar WITH THE airport.I HAD review THE federalaviationadministration airportfacility direct AS WELL AS THE pilot south organ airportfacility direct BUT THE inform WAS SCANT IN regard TO taxiway.ALSO BECAUSE I HAD land MONTEREY BEFORE _ TIME _ month PRIOR I feel I WOULD BE OKAY.EVEN THOUGH I TRY TO full BRIEF MYSELF BEFORE EACH flight I VIEW THIS AS A LESSON learn THAT I CANNOT AFFORD TO ADOPT A lax airport ATTITUDE FOR EVEN THE MOST commonplace item.thankful NO land OR departingtraffic WAS IN THE VICINITY.
