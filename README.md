Mariana is an algorithm that efficiently optimizes the hyperparameters for support vector machines for regression and classification. It currently uses simulated annealing for optimization but can be extended to use a variety of stochastic optimization techniques, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Sequential Monte Carlo, and genetic algorithms.
